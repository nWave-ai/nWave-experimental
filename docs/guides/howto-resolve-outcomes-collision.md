# How to resolve an outcomes collision

You ran `nwave-ai outcomes check-delta` (or `check`) and it exited `1`. The CLI flagged your candidate against an existing `OUT-id`. This guide walks you through the three-step triage that resolves the flag.

If you have never registered an outcome, start with the **[Your First Outcome tutorial](outcomes-first-outcome/README.md)** instead — this guide assumes you already understand the verdict matrix.

## Prerequisites

- The CLI exited `1` with one of:
  - `COLLISION: OUT-X (Tier-1 + Tier-2 <score>)`
  - `AMBIGUOUS: OUT-X (Tier-1 only)` or `(Tier-2 <score> only)`
- You have write access to `docs/product/outcomes/registry.yaml`.

## Step 1: Inspect the colliding outcome

Look up the existing outcome the CLI is pointing at. Open `docs/product/outcomes/registry.yaml` and find the entry whose `id` matches the flag. Note three fields:

- `summary` — what does the existing outcome do?
- `artifact` — where is its implementation?
- `keywords` — what intent did the registrant capture?

Example: the CLI flagged `COLLISION: OUT-E3 (Tier-1 + Tier-2 0.67)`. You read the entry:

```yaml
- id: OUT-E3
  summary: Every CommitmentRow non-empty across 4 columns
  keywords: [non-empty, required, cell]
  artifact: nwave_ai/feature_delta/domain/rules/e3_non_empty_rows.py
```

You wrote your candidate intending it to detect *cherry-picks* (downstream row count exceeds upstream without a ratifying DDD). The summary says non-empty cells. **They are different rules with overlapping vocabulary.** Move to step 2.

## Step 2: Decide link vs supersede vs annotate

Use this decision tree:

```
Is your candidate semantically equivalent to OUT-X?
├── YES, exactly the same → DO NOT REGISTER. Reuse OUT-X. Stop here.
│
├── YES, but yours improves on OUT-X (clearer, more general, or correct) →
│       SUPERSEDE: register your new OUT-id, then mark the old:
│         superseded_by: OUT-NEW
│       in the OUT-X entry. The old entry stays for audit.
│
└── NO, they are genuinely different (the CLI is over-flagging) →
    Are the keywords actually overlapping?
    ├── YES (Tier-2 fired): refine your keywords to disambiguate.
    │       Pick keywords that capture YOUR intent, not the surface area.
    │       Re-run check; if still flagged, ANNOTATE via `related`.
    │
    └── NO (only Tier-1 fired, verdict was AMBIGUOUS):
            ANNOTATE: register your candidate, then add OUT-X
            to its `related` field. This declares "we know these share
            shape; they are intentionally different rules."
```

The three actions in writing:

### Link via `related` (most common for ambiguous)

Register your candidate normally. Then edit `docs/product/outcomes/registry.yaml` and add a `related` line to the new entry:

```yaml
- id: OUT-MY-NEW
  ...
  related: [OUT-E3]
  superseded_by: null
```

This tells future authors "we considered OUT-E3, decided we are different, and the link is intentional."

### Supersede via `superseded_by`

Edit the *old* entry (not yours) to add `superseded_by: OUT-MY-NEW`. The old entry stays in the registry for audit; future `check` calls still flag the shape but the chain shows it has been replaced.

```yaml
- id: OUT-E3
  ...
  superseded_by: OUT-MY-NEW
```

Then delete or refactor the artifact (`nwave_ai/feature_delta/domain/rules/e3_non_empty_rows.py`) per your supersession plan. The registry tracks the contract; you still own the code.

### Dismiss as ambiguous (do nothing)

If the CLI exited `1` with `AMBIGUOUS` and on inspection the rules are genuinely different, the safest action is to:

1. Refine your candidate's `--keywords` so they capture your intent more precisely.
2. Re-run `nwave-ai outcomes check` with the refined keywords.
3. If still flagged, register with `related: [OUT-X]` per "Link via `related`" above.

Do **not** simply ignore the flag and ship — the next author will hit the same flag and waste time re-discovering your reasoning.

## Step 3: Re-run the check and confirm clean

After editing the registry, re-run the original check:

```bash
nwave-ai outcomes check \
  --input-shape "FeatureModel" \
  --output-shape "tuple[Violation, ...]" \
  --keywords "<your refined keywords>"
```

If the verdict is now `NO COLLISIONS` (exit `0`), proceed.

If the verdict is still `COLLISION` and you have already supersede'd or annotated, that is expected — the CLI does not look at `related` or `superseded_by` when deciding to flag (those are documentation, not gates). What matters is that your decision is *recorded* in the registry, so the next author reads the chain instead of re-litigating.

## Worked example: E3 vs E3b (cherry-pick)

This is the canonical case the registry was designed to catch.

**E3** (`OUT-E3` in the seeded registry): "Every CommitmentRow non-empty across 4 columns." Input: `FeatureDeltaModel`. Output: `tuple[ValidationViolation, ...]`. Keywords: `non-empty, required, cell`.

**E3b** (proposed during a later DISTILL wave): "Downstream wave row count >= upstream OR DDD-authorized cherry-pick." Same input. Same output shape. Keywords: `cherry-pick, row-count, ddd`.

Running the check on E3b:

```bash
nwave-ai outcomes check \
  --input-shape "FeatureDeltaModel" \
  --output-shape "tuple[ValidationViolation, ...]" \
  --keywords "cherry-pick,row-count,ddd"
```

Output:

```
AMBIGUOUS: OUT-E3 (Tier-1 only)
```

Exit `1`.

**Why ambiguous?** Tier-1 fires (identical shape — both rules walk the same model and emit the same violation tuple) but Tier-2 does not (`{cherry-pick, row-count, ddd}` ∩ `{non-empty, required, cell}` = ∅, Jaccard = 0).

**Resolution**: This is the "annotate via `related`" case. The two rules genuinely check different predicates — they happen to share the violation-collection contract. Register E3b normally, then add `related: [OUT-E3]` to its entry. The annotation says "yes, we know these collide on shape; they are intentionally separate predicates."

Six months later, when an author proposes E3c with the same shape, the chain `OUT-E3 → OUT-E3b → OUT-E3c` makes the rationale visible.

## What this guide does *not* cover

- **Auto-resolution via supersede sweep** — out of scope for the MVP. The registry tracks supersession; cleaning up superseded artifacts is manual.
- **Cross-feature collision dashboards** — defer to v2. Currently `outcomes check-delta` reports one feature at a time.
- **CI gate on collisions** — `--strict` flag is reserved for v2 (D-7 in the feature-delta DISCUSS).

If your situation is none of the above, file an issue with the exact CLI invocation and verdict so we can extend the decision tree.
