# Experimental migration-decision bundle

Before dispatching the experimental publisher, create a directory containing
`decision.json` and every file named by its relative `{file, sha256}`
references: the candidate wheel, evidence, upgrade-proof record, checkpoint
documents, and their retained command or result bytes. Package that directory
without a parent directory as `experimental-migration-decision.zip`.

Create a transport release targeted at the exact candidate commit, then upload
the bundle. The `migration-evidence-` prefix is deliberately not a `v*` product
release tag, and that prefix is what keeps this record out of the product
release sequence.

```bash
TAG=migration-evidence-<candidateSHA>
gh release create "$TAG" --target <candidateSHA> --title "$TAG"
gh release upload "$TAG" experimental-migration-decision.zip
gh workflow run publish-experimental.yml --ref atdd_pure_staging \
  -f migration_decision_release_tag="$TAG"
```

The workflow downloads, safely extracts, and validates this exact bundle before
smoking the wheel and invoking the writer.

**Do not make it a draft.** This instruction said `--draft` until 2026-09-11 and
described the draft as private transport. That was unworkable: a draft carries
no git tag and is invisible to a read-scoped token, so the publisher answered
`release not found` for a release that was present, tagged and correct (run
34580884541). Publishing the same release did not fix it on its own (run
34585321557), which ruled the draft out as the cause and exposed the real one:
this repository is private, and the download was using the cross-repo PAT that
exists to write the PUBLIC target. The publisher now reads the bundle with its
own token, and `contents: read` suffices for a published release.

The candidate wheel ships only the AST and TextSearch code-fact providers.
The source checkout's optional indexed provider and its generated index are
not public wheel assets. Check the built wheel, not only the source tree,
before attaching it to the decision bundle.
