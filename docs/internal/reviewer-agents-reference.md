## Review Feedback Format

Reviewers output structured YAML feedback:

```yaml
review_id: "rev_{timestamp}_{artifact_name}"
reviewer: "product-owner-reviewer"
artifact: "docs/feature/{feature-name}/discuss/requirements.md"

strengths:
  - "Clear acceptance criteria for checkout flow"
  - "Well-defined user personas"

issues_identified:
  confirmation_bias:
    - issue: "Technology assumption without stakeholder requirement"
      impact: "May constrain solution options unnecessarily"
      recommendation: "Re-elicit deployment constraints from stakeholders"
      severity: "critical"

  completeness:
    - issue: "Missing error scenarios for payment failure"
      impact: "Incomplete test coverage"
      recommendation: "Add scenarios: card declined, timeout, fraud detection"
      severity: "high"

recommendations:
  - "Address critical issues before DESIGN wave"
  - "Quantify performance requirements"
  - "Add compliance requirements (PCI-DSS)"

approval_status: "rejected_pending_revisions"
iteration: 1
max_iterations: 2
```

### Approval Status Values

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `approved` | All quality criteria met | Proceed to handoff |
| `rejected_pending_revisions` | Issues require fixes | Revise and resubmit |
| `conditionally_approved` | Minor issues, can proceed | Document caveats |

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| `critical` | Blocks progression, must fix | Fix before resubmission |
| `high` | Significant impact, should fix | Fix before resubmission |
| `medium` | Moderate impact | Fix if time permits |
| `low` | Minor improvement | Optional |
