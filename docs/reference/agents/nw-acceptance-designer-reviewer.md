## Preloaded skills

- [nw-ad-critique-dimensions](../skills/nw-ad-critique-dimensions.md) — Review dimensions for acceptance test quality - happy path bias, GWT compliance, business language purity, coverage completeness, walking skeleton user-centricity, priority validation, observable behavior assertions, traceability coverage, and walking skeleton boundary proof
- [nw-at-completeness-check](../skills/nw-at-completeness-check.md) — Verify that one minimal oracle falsifies every declared delivery obligation without checklist ceremony or duplicate tests.
- [nw-product-value-slicing](../skills/nw-product-value-slicing.md) — Product-owner foundation for slicing value — elephant carpaccio thin vertical slices, one walking skeleton per feature (not per slice), feature identity from user/product authority, JTBD/domain language framing. Consult when decomposing a feature into independently observable increments.
- [nw-property-based-testing](../skills/nw-property-based-testing.md) — Property-based testing strategies (PBT — ACTIVE, authored by the acceptance-designer during DISTILL), shrinking, PBT+TDD integration.
- [nw-test-design-mandates](../skills/nw-test-design-mandates.md) — Design mandates for acceptance tests - hexagonal boundary, business language abstraction, user journey completeness, pure function extraction, 3 Pillars (domain language / chained narrative / production composition), and the layered ATD discipline (Universe-bound assertion, layer-dependent PBT mode, two-tier acceptance, example-based sad paths). Lean recomposing core - routes to three narrow mandate modules.
- [nw-test-design-mandates-composition-contract](../skills/nw-test-design-mandates-composition-contract.md) — Composition-root authoring-contract mandates for acceptance tests — SSOT + Zero Duplication via Types + Services + DSL, Driving-Port-Only Boundary (Farley four-layer protocol-driver contract, fixture-theater/tautological-test anti-pattern), Contract Shape Classification (@in-memory/@real-io tag-vs-composition), and Dormant-Seam Reconciliation (AT drives the DESIGN-declared seam, not the new component). Consult while composing the AT's driving surface, structuring step/type/service code, and tagging the contract shape. Canonical definitions; SSOT for these mandates.
- [nw-test-design-mandates-scenario-design](../skills/nw-test-design-mandates-scenario-design.md) — Scenario-design mandates for acceptance tests — Hexagonal Boundary Enforcement (drive through driving ports, never internals), Business Language Abstraction (three abstraction layers), User Journey Completeness, Pure Function Extraction Before Fixtures, Algebraic Analysis Before the Scenario (name the law, find its narrowest surface, declare every gated input, prove the scenario can fail), the 3 Pillars style backbone, and Walking Skeleton Strategy. Consult while shaping or judging a scenario's boundary, language, journey completeness, and fixture strategy. Canonical definitions; SSOT for these mandates.
- [nw-typesafe-system-one](../skills/nw-typesafe-system-one.md) — Use Jev System One for every supported, authorized semantic judgment when available: relevance selection, handoff preflight, evidence mapping, finding clustering, and confidence-gated escalation.
