## Skills

- [nw-algebraic-design-protocol](../skills/nw-algebraic-design-protocol.md) — The METHOD for finding a design — name observations and equality before constructors, then follow any contradiction to the type or observation that causes it. Use when a design decision is contested, a law has exceptions, a census or model keeps producing wrong answers, or a representation change must preserve meaning. Complements nw-fp-algebra-driven-design, which catalogues the structures; this says how to arrive at one and what to do when it breaks.
- [nw-certainty-by-construction](../skills/nw-certainty-by-construction.md) — Turn a stable domain claim into a construction boundary so the invalid state cannot be built, and state honestly what remains unguarded. Use when a requirement says an invalid state or transition must not occur, when values need a canonical form, or when a rewrite/cache/optimisation must preserve meaning. Complements nw-fp-domain-modeling, which shows the encodings; this decides whether to encode, how strong the claim really is, and what obligation is left over.
- [nw-code-analysis-port](../skills/nw-code-analysis-port.md) — KNOWLEDGE — resolve code facts (who-calls-X / where-defined-or-read / call-graph / change-scope / file-atoms) through the vendor-neutral CLI `des code-fact`, degrading LOUD through bundled adapters (AST, TextSearch). Trigger: any time an agent designs, writes, analyzes, or reviews code or tests and needs a structural code fact.
- [nw-ddd-architect](../skills/nw-ddd-architect.md) — DDD architect design-time mandates — the Fixture-Fanout Enumeration Mandate for shared-substrate per-caller migration (enumerate production callers plus fixture sites plus atomic bundle scope, mechanically enforced) that both the ddd-architect and its reviewer load by name
- [nw-ddd-strategic](../skills/nw-ddd-strategic.md) — Strategic DDD — bounded context discovery, context mapping patterns, subdomain classification, ubiquitous language, and organizational alignment
- [nw-ddd-tactical](../skills/nw-ddd-tactical.md) — Tactical DDD — aggregate design rules, entities, value objects, domain events, repositories, domain services, and anti-pattern detection
