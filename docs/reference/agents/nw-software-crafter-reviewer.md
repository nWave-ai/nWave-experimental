## Skills

- [nw-at-completeness-check](../../../nWave/skills/nw-at-completeness-check/SKILL.md) — Canonical AT completeness gate — research-anchored 7-category taxonomy (C1-C7) + 15-item mechanical checklist, PLUS Tier-2 structural-invariants gate (S-family) covering test-suite SSOT invariants (S1 step-text uniqueness, S2 driving-port-only boundary / no direct-domain testing). Paradigm-neutral. Drives acceptance-designer reviewer verdict deterministically.
- [nw-sc-review-dimensions](../../../nWave/skills/nw-sc-review-dimensions/SKILL.md) — Reviewer critique dimensions for peer review - implementation bias detection, test quality validation, completeness checks, and priority validation
- [nw-tdd-methodology](../../../nWave/skills/nw-tdd-methodology/SKILL.md) — Deep knowledge for Outside-In TDD - double-loop architecture, ATDD integration, port-to-port testing, walking skeletons, and test doubles policy
- [nw-tdd-review-enforcement](../../../nWave/skills/nw-tdd-review-enforcement/SKILL.md) — Test design mandate enforcement, test budget validation, TDD phase validation (3-phase canon per ADR-025), and external validity checks for the software crafter reviewer
