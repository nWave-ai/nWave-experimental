## Preloaded skills

- [nw-architectural-styles-tradeoffs](../skills/nw-architectural-styles-tradeoffs.md) — Architectural style selection decision matrices, trade-off analysis, structural enforcement rules, and combination patterns. Load when choosing or evaluating architecture styles.
- [nw-architecture-patterns](../skills/nw-architecture-patterns.md) — Comprehensive architecture patterns, methodologies, quality frameworks, and evaluation methods for solution architects. Load when designing system architecture or selecting patterns.
- [nw-code-analysis-port](../skills/nw-code-analysis-port.md) — KNOWLEDGE — resolve code facts (who-calls-X / where-defined-or-read / call-graph / change-scope / file-atoms) through the vendor-neutral CLI `des code-fact`, degrading LOUD through bundled adapters (AST, TextSearch). Trigger: any time an agent designs, writes, analyzes, or reviews code or tests and needs a structural code fact.
- [nw-cross-cutting-invariants](../skills/nw-cross-cutting-invariants.md) — Cross-cutting normative invariants — paradigm-independent and role-independent rules that bind every architect and crafter (data justification, gate design GDP-1..9, self-explaining surfaces). SHIPPED home of these definitions; cite by clause id, never re-declare.
- [nw-domain-driven-design](../skills/nw-domain-driven-design.md) — Strategic and tactical DDD patterns, bounded context discovery, context mapping, aggregate design rules, and decision frameworks for when to apply DDD
- [nw-formal-verification-tlaplus](../skills/nw-formal-verification-tlaplus.md) — TLA+ and PlusCal for specifying distributed system invariants. Decision heuristics for when formal verification adds value, key patterns, state explosion management, and alternatives comparison.
- [nw-sa-critique-dimensions](../skills/nw-sa-critique-dimensions.md) — Architecture quality critique dimensions for peer review. Load when invoking solution-architect-reviewer or performing self-review of architecture documents.
- [nw-security-by-design](../skills/nw-security-by-design.md) — Security design principles, STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10 architectural mitigations, and secure patterns. Load when designing systems or reviewing architecture for security.
- [nw-stress-analysis](../skills/nw-stress-analysis.md) — Advanced architecture stress analysis methodology for designing systems that survive unknown stresses. Load when --residuality flag is used or when designing high-uncertainty, mission-critical systems.
