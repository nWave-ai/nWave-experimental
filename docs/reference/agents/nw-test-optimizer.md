# nw-test-optimizer

Use to minimize test count while preserving coverage. Invoke after a feature lands, when a suite feels slow or noisy, on a scheduled audit, or whenever the maintainer suspects overtesting. Detects byte-identical pairs, parametrize-inflation, language-guarantee tests, AST-shape tests, and migration-collapse opportunities. Never modifies production code.
