"""Kernel: schema-version detection + per-type upcaster chains for persisted
JSON artifacts that DES rereads across sessions/releases.

Backlog: F-ARTIFACT-VERSIONING-UPCASTING (docs/product/backlog.md). Users
upgrading nWave between releases hit artifact-format changes mid-feature.
This kernel is the reusable, event-sourcing-style upcaster pattern Ale and
Attila agreed on the 2026-08-20 call: version every persisted artifact, ship
one incremental upcaster function per shape change, and a consumer only ever
reads the LATEST shape.

Design:
  - A ``"schema-version"`` integer field. Absence of the key means version 0
    (a legacy, pre-versioning artifact) -- never an error.
  - A type's CURRENT version is the length of its registered upcaster chain.
  - Each upcaster is a pure ``dict -> dict`` function transforming EXACTLY
    v(n) -> v(n+1). ``upcast_to_current`` applies the SUFFIX of the chain
    starting at the doc's declared version, then stamps the final
    schema-version -- idempotent on a doc already at the current version.
  - A doc declaring a version GREATER than the runtime's known current
    version for its type (the file is newer than the runtime, e.g. after a
    downgrade) is refused LOUD via ``ArtifactFromFutureRuntime`` -- never
    silently truncated or ignored (GDP-6: no silent-wrong).

No filesystem I/O and no module-level mutable registry here: an
``ArtifactVersioningKernel`` is a plain, constructor-injected value built
once by the driven-adapter call site that owns a type's registrations. This
keeps the kernel pure (safe to sit in ``domain/``, same rationale as
``telemetry_paths.py``) and keeps tests free of cross-test global-state
pollution -- each test builds its own throwaway kernel with fake types.

Naming convention note: this kernel standardizes on the HYPHENATED
``"schema-version"`` key, matching the existing ``DeliveryContract`` field
(``compile_contract.py``'s ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` / ``"schema-version"``) -- the
one artifact type in this tree already versioned before this kernel existed.
Two PRE-EXISTING, UNRELATED underscored ``"schema_version"`` conventions
also exist (``schema_version_detector.py``'s legacy TDD step-file phase
cycling, and ``repo_source_probe.py``'s freshness/repo-source manifest) --
both out of this kernel's scope; do not conflate them with this key.
