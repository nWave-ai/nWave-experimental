# Advanced Architecture Stress Analysis

Complexity science-based approach for architectures surviving unknown future stresses. Based on residuality theory by Barry M. O'Reilly (Former Microsoft Chief Architect, PhD Complexity Science) — primary sources and the synthesis boundary: ADR-SSOT-002 §6a.

Core paradigm: "Architectures should be trained, not designed."

## When to Apply

Apply only on a semantic trigger, never as default ceremony: an external/
nondeterministic dependency; recovery/retry/compensation/degradation;
contagion across components; infrastructure/substrate uncertainty; a
high-uncertainty socio-technical/business boundary; or explicit
`--residuality` (force-on).

**Skip for**: stable, simple targets where none of the triggers above fire.

## Three Core Concepts

### 1. Stressors
Unexpected events challenging operation. Categories: technical (failures, scaling, breaches) | business model (pricing shifts, competitive disruption) | economic (funding, market crashes) | organizational (restructuring, skill gaps) | regulatory (compliance changes) | environmental (infrastructure failures)

Brainstorm extreme and diverse. Goal = discovery, not risk assessment.

### 2. Residues
Design elements surviving after breakdown. Ask: "What's left when [stressor] hits?"

Example -- e-commerce under payment outage: residue = browsing, cart, wishlist. Lost: checkout, payment. Stress-informed: allow "reserve order, pay later."

### 3. Attractors
States systems naturally tend toward under stress. Differ from designed intent. Discovered through testing, not predicted.

Example -- social media under growth: designed = proportional scaling, actual attractor = read-heavy CDN mode (reads survive, writes queue/fail). Design for this.

## Process

### Step 1: Create Naive Architecture
Straightforward solution for functional requirements. No speculative resilience. Document as baseline.

### Step 2: Simulate Stressors
Brainstorm the smallest diverse set that covers the categories, under an explicit budget (time-box or count agreed up front). Include extremes. Engage domain experts. Prioritize by impact, not probability. Expand only when a new stressor yields a genuinely new residue/attractor — stop once additions repeat known findings. No fixed quota.

### Step 3: Uncover Attractors
Walk each stressor with experts. Ask "What actually happens?" Identify emergent behaviors. Recognize cross-stressor patterns.

### Step 4: Identify Residues
Per attractor: which components remain? Critical vs non-critical? Stress-only dependencies?

### Step 5: Modify Architecture
Reduce coupling, add degradation modes, introduce redundancy, apply resilience patterns (circuit breakers, queues, caching) only where the residues found justify them — no universal threshold or default pattern; the fit is evidenced per system.

### Step 6: Empirical Validation
Generate a second, unseen stressor set. Apply to both naive and modified. Modified must survive more unforeseen stressors — this evidences generalization, prevents overfitting to the discovery set, and is never skipped.

## Practical Tools

### Incidence Matrix
Rows: stressors. Columns: components. Mark affected cells. Reveals vulnerable components (high column count), high-impact stressors (high row count) and coupling indicators. Not a new persisted artifact — a working aid folded into the existing architecture brief (Step 5's heuristic 7).

### Adjacency Matrix
Rows/columns: components. Mark direct connections. Coupling ratio = K/N is a relative indicator across this system's own stressor runs, not a universal threshold — compare naive vs modified architecture, never against a fixed cross-system number.

### Contagion Analysis
Model as directed graph. Simulate failure. Trace cascade. Identify SPOFs. Add circuit breakers, timeouts, fallbacks.

### Architectural Walking
Select stressor, walk behavior step-by-step with team, identify attractors/residues, propose modification, re-walk to validate, repeat.

## Design Heuristics

1. **Correctness and criticality are complementary, not alternatives**: the accepted observable contract must hold, and the system must reconfigure toward what matters most when it cannot hold everything — optimize for both, never trade one for the other
2. **Embrace strategic failure**: some parts fail so critical parts survive
3. **Solve random problems**: diverse scenarios create more robust architectures than predicted-scenario optimization
4. **Minimize connections**: default loosely-coupled; tight only when essential
5. **Design for business model attractor**: how revenue/cost constraints shape behavior under stress
6. **Train through iteration**: iterative stress-test-modify beats upfront planning
7. **Document stress context**: the existing architecture brief (ADR-SSOT-002 §6a) carries stressor analysis and resilience rationale — no separate stressor field or matrix artifact

## Integration with Other Practices

- **DDD**: stressor analysis deepens domain understanding; stress Event Storming reveals richer bounded contexts
- **Microservices**: incidence matrix validates service boundaries (low shared stressor impact = good)
- **Event-Driven**: async communication naturally reduces coupling
- **Chaos Engineering**: stressor brainstorming feeds chaos experiment design
- **ADRs**: include stressor analysis, attractors, resilience rationale

## Algebra Bridge (ADR-SSOT-002 §6a)

Residuality discovers plausible behavior under uncertainty; algebra
(`nw-algebraic-design-protocol`) owns observations, equality and laws within
and across the residues found here. Per stressor `s`, a residue names its
row: `stressor | preserved observation | allowed degradation | forbidden
outcome | recovery | boundary`. The cross-residue kernel is the NAMED set of
properties intentionally required across the selected residues — never a
blind intersection. A transformation between residues is a
structure-preserving morphism/refactoring only when its named preservation
map is stated; partial preservation is controlled degradation; a changed
user observation is a product/design change owned by its SSOT; absent
preservation is replacement, not refactoring. Correctness of the accepted
contract and criticality across stressors are complementary outcomes, never
alternatives. Rows project into the existing `DeliveryContract`
`targets`/`boundary`/`obligations` and derived tests — no new field, no
persisted matrix. On the trigger, load `nw-algebraic-design-protocol`
alongside this skill.

## Differentiation from Risk Management

Traditional: predict and prevent specific failures. This: discover candidate residues under a diverse, budgeted stressor set and validate them against a second, unseen set — evidence of broader survival, never a guarantee against any stress. Question shifts from "What risks to prepare for?" to "What happens when this stressor hits, and does the residue generalize?"
