description: Design mandates for acceptance tests - hexagonal boundary, business language abstraction, user journey completeness, pure function extraction, 3 Pillars (domain language / chained narrative / production composition), and the layered ATD discipline (Universe-bound assertion, layer-dependent PBT mode, two-tier acceptance, example-based sad paths). Lean recomposing core - routes to three narrow mandate modules.

# Acceptance Test Design Mandates (recomposing core)

This skill is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for every acceptance-test-design mandate. All mandates are enforced during peer review and must pass before handoff to software-crafter.

This core holds the cross-cutting concerns (numbering, registry, language-convention frame, compliance-verification handoff) and COMPOSES three narrow mandate modules. The canonical mandate definitions live in the modules — this core does not re-inline them.

## Assertion failure messages state WHAT / WHY / HOW (STANDING)

Every AT assertion's failure message MUST state **WHAT** observable failed (the specific
expected-vs-actual), **WHY** it matters (the contract it breaks), and **HOW** to fix (what
the implementation must make true / the concrete remediation). A bare `assert x == y` with
no message — or a message that only restates the code — is itself a defect: a RED must TEACH
the crafter exactly what to make true, not force them to reverse-engineer the intent. Same
what/why/how rule the product's own error surfaces obey.

## Durable outcome naming (STANDING)

Every acceptance-test identifier must name the durable observable value it
protects. Delivery bookkeeping is not value: never put `slice_NN` or
`slice-NN` in a test file/function name. Put that provenance in the ledger,
feature-delta, execution plan, or commit trailer instead. Before RED, derive
the identifier from the charter's value statement; a reader must understand
what is protected without opening the delivery plan. For Python, run
`des check-contract-shape --files <new-test-files>` before handoff: it blocks
delivery tokens in test functions and test filenames. Scenario titles and
parametrization IDs follow the same naming rule and are reviewer-checked
until their native test-framework parsers are added to the portable gate.

## Closure obligations — COUNT / PARTITION / SILENCE (STANDING)

Three generative obligations. They fire at AUTHORING time, on the shape of what an AT (or the
artifact it certifies) asserts — not as a gate that fires after the error. They are
domain-agnostic: a validator checks the obligation is DISCHARGED without understanding the
subject. Whenever a scenario, a charter oracle, or a design artifact emits one of these
shapes, the matching cell is filled inline while writing:

- **Emit a COUNT → name the POPULATION.** A number ("3 consumers wired", "0 findings", "5
  slices") is meaningless without its denominator: 3 of WHAT total, 0 out of a set that was
  actually enumerated. An AT asserting a count MUST also pin the population it was drawn from,
  and assert the count against that population — never a bare integer.
- **Emit a PARTITION → assert CONSERVATION.** When a whole is split into parts (buckets,
  statuses, refused/accepted halves, per-category verdicts), the parts MUST sum back to the
  whole. Assert the conservation law, not just the individual buckets — a partition whose
  pieces silently drop members is the exact defect this catches.
- **Declare SILENCE/ABSENCE → name the DISCRIMINATOR.** A "clean / nothing found / no-op /
  not-applicable" result MUST carry what distinguishes **looked-and-genuinely-absent** from
  **never-actually-looked** (no capable tier, unparseable input, swallowed error). The AT
  proves the discriminator by constructing the empty case AND a broken/incapable case and
  asserting their outputs DIFFER — the negative test no positive test can replace (Vera's
  absence ≠ incapacity, `nw-user-examiner` §8). A silence indistinguishable from a swallowed
  error is a false negative wearing a degraded alibi, never a PASS.

Why here, why inline: the obligation is SEEDED mechanically from what the design already
states — a Reuse Analysis `EXTEND` row that names a field ("binding_name plus template_parts")
already implies the population; the charter's negative oracle already implies the
discriminator. Filling the cell while authoring costs the system, not a gate firing after a
wrong path is taken (GDP-2 inline-at-authoring + GDP-5 cost-on-system). The denominator is not
documentation — it is the falsifier made mechanical.

## Composition (load by trigger)

| Module | Kind | Trigger — load when... | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nw-test-design-mandates-scenario-design` | KNOWLEDGE | shaping/judging a scenario's SHAPE — boundary, language, journey, fixtures, style | Mandates 1-4, the 3 Pillars, Walking Skeleton Strategy |
| `nw-test-design-mandates-layered-mechanics` | KNOWLEDGE | choosing test MECHANICS for a layer + adapter-realness — assertion style, PBT mode, tier, sad-path treatment | Mandates 8-11, Layered Test Discipline table, Polyglot Adapter Matrix |
| `nw-test-design-mandates-composition-contract` | KNOWLEDGE | composing the AT's DRIVING SURFACE + code contract — SSOT-via-types, driving-port-only, contract-shape tag, dormant-seam | Mandates 12-15 |

Load path: `~/.claude/skills/nw-test-design-mandates-{module}/SKILL.md`. Load the module whose trigger matches your current moment; load more than one when a task spans moments. The three triggers partition the mandate-space — every mandate lives in exactly one module.

## Numbering Convention (read before citing any mandate)

Mandate numbers are an **SSOT-internal index**, defined in exactly one place — this registry. They may be re-indexed at will when the registry is reorganized.

- **Inside the modules**: each mandate carries a number for ordering and cross-reference.
- **Everywhere else** (agents, other skills, tasks, docstrings, ADRs, tests): refer to a mandate by its **stable descriptive name** plus a pointer to this SSOT — e.g. "the Driving-Port-Only Boundary mandate (SSOT: `nw-test-design-mandates`)". Do NOT hard-code the number in external references; the number is not a contract and external code must not lock onto it.
- Existing numeric labels in test docstrings (`Mandate-12`, `Mandate-13`, ...) are legacy shorthand for the named rules; treat them as references to this SSOT, not as independent definitions.

## LANGUAGE CONVENTION FRAME (read FIRST — overrides all examples in the modules)

**Code examples in the modules use Python syntax for illustration only.** They are NOT prescriptive about target language. nWave is language-agnostic per the "genericity and agnosticism" mandate (2026-05-24).

**Before applying mandates**, detect the target project's language from manifest files: `package.json` → TypeScript/JS; `Cargo.toml` → Rust; `go.mod` → Go; `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`/`Pipfile` → Python; `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` → Java/Kotlin; `*.csproj`/`*.fsproj` → C#/F#; `Gemfile` → Ruby; `Package.swift` → Swift.

**When the target language is NOT Python**: adapt EVERY code example — replace Python imports (`from pytest_bdd import ...`, `from hypothesis import ...`), type hints, class/function syntax, test-framework idioms, directory conventions (`tests/` vs `test/` vs `__tests__/`) with target equivalents. Project conventions ALWAYS WIN over skill examples — if the user's repo has 50 TS files and zero Python files, mandates apply via TypeScript test framework, never Python pytest.

**Empirical anchor**: 5 of 5 Python code blocks in the original skill, zero TS/Go/Rust — root-cause for language-leak per F-SKILL-EXAMPLES-LANGUAGE-LEAK. Connects [[feedback_language_adapter_plugin_architecture_2026_05_24]] (genericity mandate).

## Mandate Compliance Verification

Handoff to software-crafter includes proof all mandates pass (definitions per the cited module):

- **CM-A** (Mandate 1 — scenario-design): All test files import entry points (driving ports), zero internal component imports
- **CM-B** (Mandate 2 — scenario-design): Gherkin uses business terms only, step methods delegate to services
- **CM-C** (Mandate 3 — scenario-design): Scenarios validate complete user journeys with business value
- **CM-D** (Mandate 4 — scenario-design): Business logic extracted to pure functions. Impure code isolated behind adapters. Fixture parametrization applies only to adapter layer.
- **CM-E** (Mandate 8 — layered-mechanics): Every step-method at layers 1-3 uses `assert_state_delta(before, after, universe, expected)` with port-exposed universe entries
- **CM-F** (Mandate 9 — layered-mechanics): the representative layer 3+ wiring/sad-path test is example-only; for every declared broad-input/state/failure law (e.g. `BROAD_INPUT_DOMAIN`), the smallest sufficient set of separate, budgeted semantic-PBT tests exists instead — normally one property per distinct law, combined only when one generated observation honestly falsifies all combined laws — each sited at a deterministic, replayable, law-bearing surface (real I/O not required, but the generated observation carries an explicit preservation map to the promised real-port observation), proving the SAME promised observation as the representative example — never a proxy, never a replacement for it. When no such surface exists, the result is `EVIDENCE_GAP` back to DESIGN before authoring — DESIGN names the surface and preservation map or corrects the law; the obligation is never silently downgraded to example-only
- **CM-G** (Mandate 10 — layered-mechanics): If journey is ≥3 chained scenarios with rich input space → Tier B `test_<feature>_state_machine.py` exists alongside Tier A `.feature`; Tier B's optionality is independent of the CM-F carve-out
- **CM-H** (Mandate 11 — layered-mechanics): Layer 3+ sad paths are named example-based tests; no PBT machinery imported into that sad-path set — the CM-F carve-out's semantic-PBT test(s) live in their own file(s), never merged into these examples

Evidence: import listings, grep for technical terms, walking skeleton identification, focused scenario count, pure function extraction inventory, universe-entry audit (grep for `_` prefix in universe names → flag internal-field leakage), tier-B file presence check.
