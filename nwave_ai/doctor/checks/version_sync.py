"""VersionSyncCheck — detects an upgraded package whose framework was not reinstalled.

The ``nwave-ai`` package and the deployed nWave framework are kept in lock-step by
``nwave-ai install``: every install records the package version that performed it
into ``~/.nwave/global-config.json`` (``install.installed_version``). When a
package manager later upgrades ``nwave-ai`` (``pipx upgrade`` / ``uv tool upgrade``)
but the user forgets to re-run ``nwave-ai install``, the live package version
drifts ahead of the deployed framework assets — silently, with confusing
behaviour and no signal. This check surfaces that drift.

The two public version *tracks* (the ``nwave-ai`` wheel vs. ``nWave/VERSION``) are
NOT directly comparable, so the check never compares those. It compares the live
package version against the package version *recorded at the last install* — both
the same value type, captured from the same interpreter.

Fail-open by construction: when either side cannot be determined (no recorded
version, package metadata absent, or a ``0.0.0`` sentinel) the check PASSES. An
install-health check that nags on an undeterminable-but-healthy state is worse
than silence.

Mechanism (the load-bearing assumption): ``pipx upgrade`` / ``uv tool upgrade``
mutate the package *in place* inside the existing tool venv, so the interpreter
path baked into ``settings.json`` at the last install still launches that venv
and ``importlib.metadata`` reads the *upgraded* version — which is exactly the
asymmetry this check relies on (live version moves, recorded version does not).
The rare exception is an extraordinary venv recreation (e.g. a Python minor-
version bump that forces ``pipx reinstall``): the baked interpreter path can go
stale, the hook fails to launch, and no advisory is produced — no
advisory. That degraded path is silent-but-safe and consistent with the fail-
open contract; a subsequent ``nwave-ai install`` repairs both the path and the
recorded version.
