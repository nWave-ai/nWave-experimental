"""E3b-row: Row-level bijection check (v1.1 R1).

Each downstream commitment row carries an Origin column value like
'DISCUSS#row1' that points to an upstream row by 1-based index.

Bijection rule:
- Every upstream row must have at least one downstream successor (paired
  via Origin) OR be authorized via a DDD entry in the downstream section.
- Multi-pair (1 upstream → N downstream) is valid (refinement).
- Orphan downstream rows (Origin pointing to non-existent upstream index)
  are also reported as violations.
