"""Outcome ↔ canonical-mapping serialization (pure functions).

The wire-format shape is identical for YAML persistence and JSON Schema
validation, so a single helper owns the canonical key order and field
projection. Lives in the domain layer because it is a pure transformation
of an immutable value object — no I/O, no application orchestration.
