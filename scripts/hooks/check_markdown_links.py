"""Pre-commit hook: validate relative markdown links.

Catches broken file/folder references inside markdown files. Specifically:
- Relative file links pointing at non-existent files
- Relative folder links pointing at folders without a README.md
- Stale paths after refactoring/restructuring (the recurring class of bug)

Encodes the nWave convention: a link to a folder under `docs/guides/`
must resolve to a folder containing a `README.md`. This matches the
guides layout where every doc lives in `<name>/README.md`. Folder
links elsewhere (e.g. `../../tests/`, `../../architecture/`) just need
to exist — they are browse-the-folder links, not document references.

Skipped:
- Absolute URLs (http, https, mailto, ftp, ftps, tel, data) — out of scope
- Pure anchor links (#section) — anchor validation not implemented in v1
- Files inside fenced code blocks (``` ... ```)
- Files under EXCLUDED_DIRS (audit reports, research evidence, archive)

Special handling:
- {{NWAVE_RAW_URL}}/<path> links: the placeholder is rewritten at release
  time to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nWave-ai/nWave/main/, so the
  path component is validated against the project root. A tutorial that
  points at a missing script gets caught here, not by end users hitting 404.

Usage:
    python scripts/hooks/check_markdown_links.py
    python scripts/hooks/check_markdown_links.py docs/guides/foo/README.md
