"""git-stash guard PreToolUse hook -- slice-01 of fix-crafter-stash-structural-mitigation.

A STANDALONE Claude Code PreToolUse/Bash hook that mechanically enforces the
STANDING "no git stash, use git worktree" rule (10 cumulative text-rule
violations as of 2026-05-28 -- see
[[feedback_no_worktrees_no_excessive_parallel_2026_05_19]]). The hook receives
the tool invocation event as JSON on stdin, inspects `tool_input.command`, and
dispatches:

  Fast-path (non-git-stash Bash):
    Regex-match `^\\s*git\\s+stash\\b` on the command. If NO match, exit 0
    silently -- a bare Python early-exit before any filesystem work. The
    HOOK_EVENTS registration greps the command before spawning the
    interpreter, and this Python entry point repeats the discriminator so the
    decision is unambiguous even when invoked directly.

  Mutating git-stash path (BLOCK):
    A mutating subcommand (bare `git stash`, or `push`/`pop`/`apply`/`drop`/
    `clear`/`save`/`branch`/`create`/`store`) is refused: print
    `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` to stdout + exit 2. The reason
    names the safe alternative (`git worktree add /tmp/probe HEAD`) AND the
    bypass mechanism (`NWAVE_GIT_STASH_ALLOW`) so the operator sees an
    actionable remedy.

  Read-only git-stash path (ALLOW):
    `git stash list`, `git stash show` (incl. `-p`), and any `git stash`
    carrying `--help`/`-h` are read-only/help forms -- exit 0 silently.

  Kill-switch (ALLOW + audit):
    When the command IS a mutating `git stash` AND `NWAVE_GIT_STASH_ALLOW` is
    set to a truthy value (any non-empty string that is not `0`/`false`/`no`/
    `off`, case-insensitive),
    the hook APPROVES (exit 0) and emits one audited `GitStashBypassUsed`
    event (JSONL) to `<target>/.nwave/des/logs/audit-{today}.log`. The event
    carries the `command` field so the operator sees which stash invocation
    was deliberately allowed.

Substrate (Ale 2026-05-28 framing): Claude Code hook lifecycle. NOT git. The
pre-commit framework's INTERNAL `git stash` ("Stashing unstaged files") is a
subprocess spawned BY the pre-commit binary, NOT a Claude `Bash` tool
invocation, so it is never intercepted by this PreToolUse hook.

Stdlib-only (no PyYAML, no third-party deps). Uses the standard PreToolUse/Bash
protocol: JSON stdin, block decision, and audited kill-switch bypasses.

Hook protocol contract (Claude Code PreToolUse on Bash):
    stdin = {"tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": {"command": "...", ...}, ...}
    stdout (block) = {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}
    stdout (approve) = "" (empty; exit code 0 is the signal)
    exit 0 = allow tool invocation
    exit 2 = block tool invocation (with stdout JSON for reason)

Test-harness env-var contract (slice-01 ATs):
    NWAVE_GIT_STASH_ALLOW -- kill-switch; truthy value bypasses the block
        (audited GitStashBypassUsed event).
    NWAVE_GIT_STASH_GUARD_TARGET_ROOT -- target machine root override so the
        hook locates the audit-log dir without relying on Path.cwd().

In production (no target-root override), the hook uses `Path.cwd()` as the
target root and `<target>/.nwave/des/logs/` as the audit-log dir.
