"""Shared public/private agent filtering logic.

Used by installer plugins and build scripts to exclude private agents
and their skills from public distributions. The source of truth is
``nWave/framework-catalog.yaml`` where each agent has a ``public`` field.

Fail-closed semantics (default): when the catalog file is missing,
``load_public_agents`` raises ``CatalogNotFoundError``. When the catalog
cannot be parsed, it raises ``CatalogParseError``. Pass ``strict=False``
for backward compatibility (returns empty set on missing catalog).

**Important**: PyYAML must be installed. If missing, ``load_public_agents``
raises ``RuntimeError`` instead of silently returning an empty set (which
would cause all agents to be treated as public -- a security leak).
