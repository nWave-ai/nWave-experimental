"""Worktree-aware resolution of the shared ``.git/hooks`` directory.

Single source of truth for both attribution install and uninstall paths.
The same hooks-dir resolution logic previously existed in three places
(two in ``attribution_utils``, one in a sibling test fixture) and the
production callers picked the wrong git API (``--show-toplevel``) while
the sibling test had the right one (``--git-common-dir``). Extracting
the helper collapses the surface to one definition that all callers
share.

    Works in both regular checkouts and linked worktrees by invoking
    ``git rev-parse --git-common-dir`` — the worktree-aware analogue of
    ``--show-toplevel``. In a linked worktree, ``.git`` is a pointer
    *file* (not a directory), so any caller that joins ``.git/hooks``
    onto the worktree top-level resolves to a non-existent path. The
    common-dir path resolves instead to the SHARED ``.git`` directory of
    the main checkout, which is also the right policy target — the
    ``prepare-commit-msg`` trailer applies to all branches and worktrees,
    not per-worktree.

    Pure function (only side effect: subprocess invocation against the
    surrounding git repo). No global state, no caching, no ``os.chdir``.
    Lets ``subprocess.CalledProcessError`` and friends propagate to the
    caller — the existing call sites already handle them.
