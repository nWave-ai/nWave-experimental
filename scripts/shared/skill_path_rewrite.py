"""Per-host skill-path rewrite -- single source of truth for body path rewriting.

Installer plugins deploy agent and skill bodies into per-host directories. The
canonical Claude Code source body references ``~/.claude/skills/`` (and sibling
``~/.claude/...`` prefixes). For non-Claude hosts those tokens point at a dead
path and MUST be rewritten to the host's own base.

This module exposes one pure function, :func:`rewrite_host_paths`, consumed by
all four host plugins (codex-agents, codex-skills, opencode-skills,
opencode-agents). It re-uses the host->base mapping SSOT already defined in
``scripts.shared.platform_contracts`` -- no new path constants are introduced.

The exception-aware char-scan loop is the canonical algorithm extracted from
``opencode_commands_plugin._rewrite_paths``: rules are applied in order and each
match is checked against the host's exception prefixes before being rewritten.

The function is pure (no IO, no side effects) and idempotent -- applying it to
already-rewritten content is a fixpoint, since no ``~/.claude/...`` rule matches
a host base that has already been substituted.
