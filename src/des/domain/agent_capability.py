"""What an agent's published spec DECLARES it can do -- and the REGISTER in
which a briefing may therefore speak about that agent's access.

RCA: docs/feature/fix-examiner-blindness-enforced/rca.md (root causes A + D).
``des dispatch`` told every reader of a NON-CODE-FACING envelope that the
dispatched agent had no source / design / acceptance-test access "BY
CONSTRUCTION". Nothing enforced that: the predicate behind the claim was a
frozenset of agent NAMES, never computed from what the agent can actually DO,
while the examiner's own frontmatter granted unrestricted ``Read`` and
``Bash``. "By construction" is precisely the instruction to the orchestrator to
STOP verifying, so the unenforced constraint was also unchecked.

This module supplies the FACT the claim must be derived from, and the
vocabulary the framework was missing (root cause D) -- three mutually
exclusive registers:

``ENFORCED``
    The declared tools grant NOTHING that reaches the tree. An absolute ("by
    construction" / "cannot read") is EARNED here and only here: an ungranted
    tool is genuinely uncallable, so the declaration IS the mechanism.
``INSTRUCTED``
    The role is non-code-facing by INTENT, but its declared tools DO grant a
    source-reaching capability. The honest register: instructed, not
    prevented -- and the reader is owed a concrete place to confirm it.
``UNKNOWN``
    The spec was not found, or carries no parseable frontmatter. Degrade LOUD
    (GDP-6): "I looked and she is blind" and "I never looked" must not produce
    the same sentence. An unreadable capability is an INDETERMINATE, never an
    inferred one -- and NEVER the permissive ``ENFORCED``.

Two deliberate safety properties:

1. **Fail-safe classification.** A tool this module does not recognise is
   treated as SOURCE-REACHING. The only way to reach ``ENFORCED`` is for every
   declared tool to be on the known non-source-reaching list, so an unknown
   tool can never manufacture a false absolute.
2. **First EXISTING candidate wins -- no fall-through on a parse failure.**
   The checkout the caller POINTED AT is consulted before the installed tree
   (a resolver that ignores the checkout it was handed cannot be
   capability-derived in a dev tree). A candidate that exists but will not
   parse yields ``UNKNOWN``; it must NOT silently fall through to a different
   deployment's copy of the spec, which would answer a question about a file
   the caller never named.

The same frontmatter also carries the role's ``model:``, exposed as
``declared_model``. It is read HERE, from the same resolved file, because a
model answered from one copy of a spec and a capability answered from another
would describe two different roles under one name -- and the provider honours
the model on the argv, not the one a distant copy declares. A caller that finds
``None`` must degrade LOUD: supplying a default would put the model back in a
second place, which is exactly what this field removes.

An OMITTED ``tools:`` key is NOT an empty capability -- in Claude Code the
omission INHERITS every tool, i.e. maximally permissive. It resolves to
``INSTRUCTED``, never ``ENFORCED``.

Target-machine agnostic: Python + stdlib only. No git, no external CLI.
