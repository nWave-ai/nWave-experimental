"""DES Enforcement Policy - step-id based enforcement rule.

Pure domain policy following PolicyResult pattern.
Every Agent prompt containing a step-id pattern (\\d{2}-\\d{2}) without DES
markers gets blocked. This closes the bypass where the orchestrator delegates
via Task but forgets DES markers.

The step-id pattern is the single structural invariant: if you mention a step ID,
you are doing step execution work that requires DES monitoring.
