"""Regression: ``nwave-ai attribution off`` must de-trap a broken machine.

Root cause C (RCA fix-attribution-install-coupling, strand C):
    ``nwave-ai attribution off`` (``nwave_ai/cli.py`` off branch) only edited
    ``settings.json`` -- it cleared the preference, scrubbed the legacy settings
    credit, and unregistered the PreToolUse hook -- but it NEVER removed the
    legacy ``prepare-commit-msg`` git shim. So a user whose machine is already
    broken by an orphaned shim (the runtime target deleted, the shim left
    behind) cannot recover with the one obvious remediation command: ``off`` is
    a no-op against the actual blocker. The fix wires ``off`` to the hardened
    ``migrate_legacy_hook`` so turning attribution off removes the shim too.

Trap construction (deterministic, version-independent):
    Mirrors ``test_attribution_migrate_no_orphan_shim``. A real tmp git repo
    whose effective hooks dir is diverted away from the real ``.git/hooks`` via
    a LOCAL ``core.hooksPath`` pointing at an empty decoy. The real shim is
    planted in ``<toplevel>/.git/hooks`` -- the historical ``--show-toplevel``
    target reached only by the hardened (01-02) migration probe. The CLI ``off``
    path is driven for real; only the unrelated ~/.claude side effects
    (settings migration, hook unregister) are stubbed so the test never touches
    the real home dir.

    On the pre-fix code: ``off`` never calls migrate -> shim survives -> RED.
    On the fixed code: ``off`` calls migrate_legacy_hook -> shim removed -> GREEN.

Bypass (Gate 12 delta-first): the load-bearing claim is a single relational
invariant -- "the orphaned shim is gone after off" -- so a direct assertion is
clearer than a state-delta universe here (mirrors the sibling 01-02 test).
