Feature: DES Installation Bug Detection Walking Skeleton
  As a developer
  I want to verify the DES plugin test infrastructure works
  So that I can reliably detect installation bugs

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized

  @walking-skeleton @priority-critical
  Scenario: Verify DES plugin can be tested
    Given the DES plugin is installed
    When I check the installation status
    Then the DES module should be present at "~/.claude/lib/python/des"
    And the real settings.json file should exist
    And I should be able to import from scripts.install.plugins.des_plugin
