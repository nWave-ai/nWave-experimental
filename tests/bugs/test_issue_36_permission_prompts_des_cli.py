"""Regression test for nwave-ai/nwave#36 — permission prompts in DES CLI.

Three assertion levels (upgrading theater→runtime):

1. No banned PYTHONPATH=.../python3 -m des.cli.* pattern exists in 3 skills
   and 3 task files.                                            (source-level)
2. Five DES shim executables are installed under ~/.claude/bin/ and are
   executable by the current user.                               (stat-level)
3. shutil.which("des-log-phase", path=<settings env.PATH>) returns non-None
   on a staged install.                                       (runtime-level)

Stat-level tests (1+2) remain for fast source regression detection.
Runtime assertion (3) catches the class of failure that stat misses: absent
~/.claude/lib/python/des/ -> ImportError at execution time, but all stat
checks green.  The authoritative runtime contract lives in the E2E test
tests/e2e/test_fresh_install.py (requires Docker).

Both tests (1+2) are EXPECTED TO FAIL on master until steps 01-05 (shim
install) and 01-06 (skill rewrite) complete.
