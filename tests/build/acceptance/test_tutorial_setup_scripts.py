"""Acceptance tests for tutorial setup scripts.

Discovers every `docs/guides/*/setup.py` and exercises it in an isolated
tmpdir. Catches drift between a tutorial's documented setup and its
automated counterpart.

Per docs/internal/writing-tutorials.md, each setup.py must:
- Exit 0 on a fresh run
- Create at least one non-hidden directory in cwd (proves it did something)
- Be idempotent on a second run (skip-if-exists)
- Support --force to wipe and recreate

Tests parametrize over discovered scripts. The test file passes trivially
when no scripts exist yet (early in the rollout).

    Consolidated lifecycle test (Lyra 2026-05-18 speedup): runs the full

    invocations instead of 4 separate tests with 6 invocations. Net win
    on this file alone: 24 tests x ~25s avg ≈ 600s → 6 tests x ~12s ≈ 72s
    (≈8x faster).

    Contract verified, in order:
      1. Fresh run exits 0 (subprocess #1)
      2. Setup created at least one non-hidden directory (filesystem check)
      3. Re-running on the same tmpdir is idempotent (subprocess #2 exits 0)
      4. After --force, the sentinel file inside the project directory is
         wiped and the project directory is recreated (subprocess #3)

    Splitting these into 4 separate tests would let pytest report which
    behaviour broke independently, but the cost is 3-4x wall-time per
    script. The trade-off is acceptable because the failure message of
    this single test names the specific contract clause that broke (the
    assert messages below remain granular), and the test_id (= script
    directory name) still identifies which tutorial regressed.
