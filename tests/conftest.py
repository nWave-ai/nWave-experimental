    Two HEAD fields exist by design (adversarial review D1 fix):
    ``HEAD_raw`` is what restore writes back so a symbolic-ref HEAD
    (``ref: refs/heads/<branch>\\n``) is preserved across restores —
    writing the resolved SHA would leave the worktree in detached-HEAD
    state. ``HEAD_resolved`` is what diff compares so ``git commit``
    (which only mutates ``refs/heads/<branch>``, not HEAD itself) is
    detected as a corruption: the resolved target advances even though
    HEAD's literal bytes are unchanged.

    The ``packed_refs`` field exists by design (Step 01-02 fix for the
    residual-RCA false-positive). It lets ``_diff_git_state`` distinguish
    routine git housekeeping (a packed ref gets promoted to a loose file
    with the same SHA — ignore) from genuine pollution (a brand-new ref
    appears with a SHA never seen in packed-refs — flag).

    Designed for ``_diff_git_state`` (returns subset of {"config","HEAD","refs"}
    naming what changed). Worktree gitdir indirection is resolved via
    ``_resolve_git_common_dir`` and ``_resolve_head_path``.

    Returns ``None`` for missing files instead of raising — a non-existent
    repo is still a deterministic state to diff against.

# Shared-state serialization guard: pin every test that drives a subprocess
# with cwd=<real repo> onto one xdist worker group (2026-06-21).
#
# Symptom: under the pre-push leg
#   pytest -m "unit or integration or acceptance" -n 2 --dist=loadgroup
# tests pass in isolation but fail ORDER-DEPENDENTLY in-suite (e.g.
# slice-04 carpaccio, feature_delta slice-02/03 cascade).
#
# Root cause: ~40+ test suites spawn `des`/CLI subprocesses with
# ``cwd=_REPO_ROOT`` (the real repo). Those subprocesses read/write the
# repo's SHARED .nwave state — ``.nwave/wave-active/active.json`` (the wave
# floor read by pre_tool_use_handler via Path.cwd()) and the
# ``.nwave/telemetry/...`` event logs. Two such tests landing on the SAME
# worker collide on that shared on-disk state.
#
# Fix (test-infra only, no production change): detect cwd=real-repo
# dependence by scanning the item's own test module AND its sibling
# ``composition*.py`` / ``*steps*/`` modules for a ``cwd=<real repo>``
# subprocess call (most suites keep the call in a composition / step module
# the test imports, not in the test file itself), then pin the item to the
# ``real_repo_scan`` xdist group. Under ``--dist=loadgroup`` every member of
# that group runs on one worker — serialized, never concurrent. This mirrors
# the manual pin already present in four suite-local conftests (e.g.
# tests/des/acceptance/atdd_pure_common_audit_log_ssot/conftest.py),
# generalised so new suites are covered automatically without a hardcoded
# path list.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A subprocess ``cwd=`` argument that resolves to the REAL repo checkout is
# the load-bearing signal — NOT the anchor variable's name (suites spell it
# ``_REPO_ROOT``, ``REPO_ROOT``, ``PROJECT_ROOT``, ``_repo_root()``,
# ``Path.cwd()`` interchangeably). We match the ``cwd=`` keyword immediately
# followed by such an anchor. ``cwd=tmp_path`` / ``cwd=sandbox`` /
# ``cwd=tmp_repo`` etc. deliberately do NOT match: those subprocesses run in
# an isolated tmp dir and never touch the shared .nwave state.
