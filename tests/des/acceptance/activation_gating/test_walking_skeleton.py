"""Walking-skeleton binding — project-activation-gating (DISTILL scaffold).

One demo-able end-to-end journey through the production composition root: a
developer activates a project, the marker is written and made trackable, the
banner is preserved. Tagged @walking_skeleton @driving_port @real-io.

SKIPPED at the module level so the suite stays green now; DELIVER removes the
skip first (it is the one-at-a-time entry point) and implements until GREEN.
