"""Composition root for the des-verify-integrity mode-aware acceptance slice.

ADR-028 D4.2 / slice-02 (Mandate-12, Pillar 3). Wires the PRODUCTION
des-verify-integrity CLI entry point (`des.cli.verify_deliver_integrity.main`)
against a tmp_path deliver project. Business logic lives here as the single
source of truth; step bodies delegate to `VerifyIntegrityComposition` methods
and never inline logic.

Layer 2 (component: driving port invoked in-process via main(argv) under
redirect_stdout, real FS on tmp_path). No PBT machinery (Mandate 9/11).

Mode resolution: slice-02 reads `workflow.mode` from
`{project_dir}/.nwave/config.yaml`, the SAME path slice-01's des-init-log uses
(`init_log._resolve_workflow_mode`). The composition writes that file so the
ATs exercise the production resolver, not a test re-implementation.

Classic fixtures: the classic (roadmap-based) deliver project is built with the
PRODUCTION `des-roadmap init` CLI (`des.cli.roadmap.main`) so the roadmap.json
is schema-valid by construction -- the no-regression ATs assert the existing
0/1/2 contract against a real classic project, not a hand-rolled JSON shape.
