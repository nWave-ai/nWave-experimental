"""Production composition root for the commit-author-identity acceptance suite.

Pillar 3 — "app as in production": the SUT is built from the real production
entry points, never re-implemented here. The four driving surfaces are:

  1. ``is_valid_author_email`` / ``is_valid_author_name`` — pure validator core
     (layer 1/2 in-memory acceptance; direct call, no I/O).
  2. ``validate_author_identity.main()`` — the pre-commit entry, run as a real
     ``git`` subprocess in an isolated ``tmp_path`` repo (layer 3).
  3. ``validate_push_identity.main()`` — the pre-push entry, fed a real ref line
     on stdin over the same isolated repo (layer 3).
  4. ``ci_author_check.main(argv)`` — the authoritative CI runner, driven over a
     commit range in the isolated repo, returning an exit code (layer 3).

The ONE environment substitution is the git repository itself: every git
subprocess runs inside a ``tmp_path`` repo whose ``HOME`` and
``GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`` are redirected so it can NEVER touch the host
``.git/config`` (pairs with the ``tests/conftest.py`` ``_git_ceiling`` +
``_git_pollution_guard`` autouse fixtures). This is the driven-internal FS/git
port at layer 3 (example-based), exactly as the Architecture of Reference and
``docs/architecture/atdd-infrastructure-policy.md`` (``git`` probe row)
prescribe. Nothing is faked: there is no non-deterministic external port in this
feature (no clock/email/network), so there is nothing to substitute.

Production symbols are imported LAZILY inside methods so this module imports
cleanly today (tests COLLECT, never BROKEN). The validators at
``scripts/hooks/{validate_author_identity,validate_push_identity,ci_author_check}.py``
are implemented; the lazy imports resolve to the real functions and the gates
return real verdicts. The test-delta in this module adds NAME-validation and
robustness coverage that is EXPECTED-RED until the push/CI runners are extended
to validate author/committer NAMES (adversarial review R3-F1/F3).

Mandate-12 criteria:
- (2) every service method consumes the typed enums from ``domain_types`` — no
  raw ``str`` where a domain enum exists.
- (3) the step bodies in ``steps_commit_author_identity.py`` are ≤2 statements
  ending in ``composition.<method>(...)`` — all logic lives HERE and in
  production, never inlined in a step.

        Faithfully models the M2 robustness defect (adversarial review): the
        pre-push runner reads ``git log --format=%H\\t%an\\t%ae\\t%ce`` and splits
        on the tab. When the author NAME itself contains a tab, the column split
        misaligns — the runner reads a name fragment as the "author email" and
        the real placeholder author email is shifted into the committer column,
        so the rejection is mis-attributed (or, with a different name shape,
        could be read from the wrong field entirely).

        Construction (verified empirically): author name
        ``"Half\\tok@users.noreply.github.com"`` + author email ``"t@t.com"``
        (a known placeholder) + a clean committer. After the buggy split the
        runner reads ``author_email = "ok@users.noreply.github.com"`` (the name's
        second half — a CLEAN-looking value) and never validates ``t@t.com`` as
        the author field; ``t@t.com`` survives only as whitespace inside the
        garbled committer column. The placeholder author email is therefore
        never reported as a placeholder — the observable the M2 ``Then`` asserts.
        Nothing here helps the gate; the harness only reproduces a real commit
        shape git permits.
