"""Enforcement-gate binding (LIVE regression guards) -- plugin-skill-deliverable-type.

Binds ONLY the existing-behaviour-preservation scenarios from
``deliverable-type-enforcement.feature`` -- the ones that assert the app-code
enforcement path is 100% unchanged by this feature (ADR-PST-001 "app-code paths
byte-identical"). These are GREEN today against the production policy (the
``__SCAFFOLD__`` exempt branch raises ONLY for plugin/skill, never for these
cases), so they are the committable resting state and a genuine regression net.

The not-yet-implemented scenarios (plugin/skill exemption -- incl. the
`@walking_skeleton`) live in ``test_enforcement_pending.py`` under a module-level
skip, the One-at-a-Time way (ADR-025): DELIVER unskips them as it greens the
policy short-circuit. SPIKE was DISCARDED (no promoted skeleton), so the WS is
parked-skipped at DISTILL and DELIVER greens it first.

`scenario()` (singular) binds each guard by exact title -- a per-scenario binding
that lets the RED siblings be parked separately without skipping these guards.
