"""Config-resolution binding -- plugin-skill-deliverable-type (DISTILL scaffold).

Binds the POSITIVE-resolution scenarios of ``deliverable-type-resolution.feature``
to the shared step vocabulary. Resolution precedence: project declaration ->
global default -> detection (ADR-PST-002).

``scenario()`` (singular) binds each positive scenario by exact title -- a
per-scenario binding (mirroring ``test_enforcement_binding.py``) that lets the
RED siblings be parked separately. Steps 01-01 + 01-03 green the positive
resolution path:
  1. a project's own declaration is honoured (project-plugin / project-skill);
  2. a machine-wide default stands in when the project is silent (global-plugin).

The not-yet-built scenarios are parked OUT of this module (not bound, not
skipped):
  - the mis-spelled / fail-safe scenarios (PROJECT_TYPO, PROJECT_TYPO_WITH_ROOT_
    SKILLS, ABSENT) -> step 03-02;
  - detection-fallback -> phase 02.
DELIVER binds those as their steps land.

CONTRACT_SHAPE_NOTE (phase-01 review D1): the deferred
"A mis-spelled declaration is not rescued by a root skills folder" scenario is
tagged @contract-shape:unbounded-preservation. When step 03-02 binds it, its
Then step MUST assert via assert_state_delta over the full universe
(project_config.text, global_config.text, resolved_type, gate.outcome, and a
root FS-tree-hash proving no mutation) -- a single resolved_type slot assertion
would be a Contract Shape compliance failure at activation.
