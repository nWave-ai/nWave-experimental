E2E WIRING TESTS: Validate nWave commands integrate turn counting, timeout warnings, and extension API

PERSONA: Marcus (Senior Developer)
STORY: As a senior developer, I want to verify that turn counting, timeout warnings,
       and extension API are all wired into actual nWave command execution paths
       (/nw:execute and /nw:develop), so that these features work during real
       command invocations (EXTERNAL VALIDITY).

PROBLEM: Features exist in isolation but may not be properly integrated into the
         orchestrator's command execution loop. Without E2E validation, we cannot
         be certain these features execute during real commands. Both primary nWave
         commands must have full DES feature integration.

SOLUTION: Create comprehensive E2E tests that:
          - Invoke /nw:execute and /nw:develop with real command paths
          - Validate turn_count increments in step file
          - Validate timeout warnings emit when thresholds crossed
          - Validate extension request API is callable and updates limits
          - Prove features are wired into actual execution for BOTH commands

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Proves external validity of turn/timeout features
- Validates integration across all components
- Prevents integration failures in production
- Ensures audit trail completeness
- Confirms feature parity between /nw:execute and /nw:develop

        Business Context:
        Marcus runs `/nw:execute @software-crafter steps/08-01.json` and expects:
        1. Turn counting tracks agent iterations
        2. Timeout warnings alert approaching limits
        3. Extension API allows requesting more time
        4. All features proven to work in real command execution

        EXTERNAL VALIDITY PROVEN:
        This test validates features work in actual command path, not just unit tests.
        Integration failures would be caught here before production deployment.
