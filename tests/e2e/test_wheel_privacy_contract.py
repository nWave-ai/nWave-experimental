"""E2E: Distributed nwave-ai wheel contains no private or closed-source files.

Migrated from: tests/e2e/Dockerfile.verify-hotfix-batch (Test 5 only)
Layer 4 of platform-testing-strategy.md

Supply-chain privacy contract for the public PyPI wheel.  Each of the
11 assertions below maps to a class of material that MUST NOT ship:

  1. No docs/analysis/           — internal RCA reports, audits
  2. No docs/feature/            — in-flight feature tracking + acks
  3. No .github/                 — CI/CD workflows, secrets references
  4. No src/des/                 — DES source (closed-source runtime)
  5. No tests/ .py               — test fixtures and tooling
  6. No .secrets / .key          — credentials, tokens
  7. No pyproject.toml           — internal build config (distinct from METADATA)
  8. No scripts/release/         — release-automation tooling (private)
  9. No scripts/hooks/           — pre-commit hook scripts (dev-only)
 10. No scripts/framework/       — framework build utilities (dev-only)
 11. No scripts/validation/      — CI validators (dev-only)

The installed site-packages directory is inspected inside a container
that has run ``pipx install --pre nwave-ai``; each assertion is an
existence check over the shipped files, not a build-side scan.

Other hotfix-batch tests (#34 hook stdout, #33 regex, #32 gitignore,
#29 user skills survive) are out of scope for this migration — they
cover orthogonal regression surfaces and would require the broader RC
install rig.

Requires a Docker daemon.  Skips gracefully when Docker is unavailable.
