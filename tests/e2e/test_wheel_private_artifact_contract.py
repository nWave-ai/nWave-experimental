"""Walking-skeleton e2e: the public wheel carries no `public: false` artifact.

Feature: fix-installer-private-skill-leak, slice-01 (`@walking_skeleton`).

This is the GENUINE end-to-end test required by G-WIRING-1 (friction log
``docs/analysis/atdd-pure-dogfooding-friction-2026-05-20.md``, "Hard gates
to add"): the slice-01 walking-skeleton ATs in
``tests/installer/acceptance/private_skill_leak/`` run the privacy strip
*in-process* against a copied tree — they verify the strip FUNCTION, not the
release PIPELINE. They never inspect a real ``.whl``.

This test closes two gaps:

  * GAP-D — the existing slice-01 ATs inspect a tree the test itself strips;
    they never build the artifact a customer actually receives.
  * the e2e-layer gap — ``tests/e2e/test_wheel_privacy_contract.py`` asserts
    PATH-CLASSES (no ``docs/analysis/``, no ``src/des/`` ...) but never asserts
    that no ``public: false`` AGENT or privately-owned SKILL ships.

Mechanism — subprocess-real, no Fixture Theater:

  * The ``pypi_shape_wheel`` session fixture (``tests/e2e/conftest.py``)
    builds a real PyPI-shape ``.whl`` by running the EXACT release pipeline
    as subprocesses: ``build_dist.py`` → ``patch_pyproject.py`` →
    ``python -m build --wheel``. No live PyPI, no in-process strip.
  * This test then unzips that real ``.whl`` and inspects the shipped
    ``nWave/agents/`` and ``nWave/skills/`` against the catalog allow-list.

Contract asserted (slice-01 core, both halves — they are inseparable):

  1. PRIVACY — zero agent flagged ``public: false`` in
     ``framework-catalog.yaml`` survives into the wheel; zero privately-owned
     skill directory survives.
  2. SURVIVAL — every load-bearing public skill in
     ``scripts.shared.agent_catalog.PUBLIC_SHARED_SKILLS`` (the skills with
     no owning public agent that public installs still depend on) survives.

Expected result on the current tree: see the module docstring's "Pipeline
gap" note below — if the release pipeline does not strip before
``python -m build``, this test is RED, and that RED is the finding, not a
test bug. Slice-01's in-process ATs cannot see this because they strip the
tree themselves before inspecting it.

Tagged ``@slice-01 @walking_skeleton @wiring_e2e`` — this IS the slice-01
walking skeleton for fix-installer-private-skill-leak. It is the genuine
end-to-end test: real composition root, real release pipeline run as
subprocesses, real ``.whl`` unzipped and inspected. It supersedes the
fixture-folded in-process ``@walking_skeleton`` scenario that previously
lived in ``wheel-privacy.feature`` (that scenario stripped a tree the test
itself copied and never built an artifact a customer receives — false
GREEN by construction).

Mutation-flippability is the litmus: deleting the privacy-strip call in
``scripts/release/patch_pyproject.py`` (or its force-include) must flip
this test RED. Verified 2026-05-20.
