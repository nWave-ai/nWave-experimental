Feature: Feature-delta validation catches cross-wave drift before merge
  As Ale, the nwave maintainer authoring features through the wave methodology
  I want commit-time structural validation of feature-delta.md
  So that protocol-surface erosion and silent commitment drops are caught
  in under one second instead of two-hour RCA sessions hours later

  Background:
    Given a clean working directory with no prior nwave-ai state
    And the nwave-ai binary is on PATH

  # Walking Skeleton — the dogfood (proves v1.0 catches the original
  # token-billing failure exemplar that triggered this entire epic)

  Scenario: WS dogfood — validator catches token-billing silent erosion
    Given the token-billing failure exemplar at "runs/nwave-attempt/feature-delta.md"
    And the exemplar DISCUSS section commits to "real WSGI handler bound to /api/usage"
    And the exemplar DESIGN section weakens this to "framework-agnostic dispatcher" with no DDD ratification
    When the maintainer runs "nwave-ai validate-feature-delta runs/nwave-attempt/feature-delta.md" via subprocess
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stderr names the offender file and line of the DESIGN row
    And stderr contains the protocol surface "WSGI" as missing downstream
    And stderr suggests adding a DDD entry or restoring the commitment
    And no file outside the path argument was modified

  # E1 — Section presence (US-02)
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------

  @US-02 @AC-1
  Scenario: Well-formed feature-delta passes E1 within budget
    Given a well-formed feature-delta with DISCUSS, DESIGN, and DISTILL sections
    When the maintainer runs the validator against the file
    Then the exit code is 0 within 1 second
    And the output reports E1 PASS

  @US-02 @AC-2 @error
  Scenario: Section heading typo reported with did-you-mean
    Given a feature-delta where the DISCUSS heading is typed "## Wave : DISCUSS" with an extra space
    When the maintainer runs the validator
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stderr names the file and line of the malformed heading
    And stderr suggests "## Wave: DISCUSS" as the closest valid heading

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # E2 — Column presence (US-02)
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------

  @US-02 @AC-3 @error
  Scenario: Missing DDD column reported with file and line
    Given a feature-delta where the DESIGN commitments table omits the "DDD" column
    When the maintainer runs the validator
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stderr contains "missing column 'DDD'"
    And stderr names the file and line of the malformed table header

  @US-03 @AC-3 @error
  Scenario: Cherry-picked commitment blocked at commit time
    Given DISCUSS contains 3 commitment rows
    And DESIGN contains only 2 commitment rows
    And no DDD entry authorizes the removal of the third row
    When the maintainer runs the validator
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stderr names the missing commitment by Commitment-column text
    And stderr suggests "Add DDD entry OR restore row"

  @US-03 @AC-4
  Scenario: Authorized commitment removal passes E3b by ratification
    Given DISCUSS contains 3 commitment rows
    And DESIGN contains 2 commitment rows plus DDD-1 stating "drop CLI commitment because feature is API-only"

    Then the exit code is 0
    And stderr names "`nw login --device-trust`" as the missing protocol surface

  @US-04 @AC-3
  Scenario: Authorized protocol downgrade passes E5 by ratification
    Given DISCUSS commits to "real WSGI handler"
    And DESIGN commits to "framework-agnostic dispatcher"
    And DDD-1 authorizes the change with reason "runtime probes confirm equivalence"
    And the DESIGN Impact column cites "DDD-1"
    When the maintainer runs the validator
    Then the exit code is 0
    And the output reports E5 PASS by ratification

    Given DISCUSS contains 3 commitment rows
    And DESIGN contains 3 commitment rows each with an Origin annotation citing the upstream row
    When the maintainer runs the validator with rule R1 enabled
    Then the exit code is 0
    And every upstream row has at least one downstream successor

  @US-11 @AC-2 @error
  Scenario: Partial row pairing reports orphan upstream rows
    Given DISCUSS contains 3 commitment rows
    And DESIGN contains only 1 commitment row citing "Origin: DISCUSS#row1"
    And no DDD entry authorizes removal of rows 2 or 3

  Scenario: Italian protocol-verb list loads with at least three patterns
    Given the shipped Italian protocol-verb list at "nWave/data/protocol-verbs/it.txt"
    When the validator loads the Italian verb list
    Then the loaded list contains at least 3 patterns
    And the file is UTF-8 encoded without BOM

  @US-13 @AC-2 @real-io
  Scenario: Italian E5 catches drift on Italian protocol verb
    Given a feature-delta with DISCUSS commitment in Italian "L'utente fa POST su /api/usage"
    And DESIGN drops the POST commitment with no DDD ratification
    When the maintainer runs the validator with Italian patterns loaded
    Then the exit code is 1
    And stderr names "POST /api/usage" as missing

  @US-13 @AC-3 @real-io
  Scenario Outline: Header-only language stub loads to empty list

  @US-13 @AC-4 @error @security
  Scenario: User-supplied verb pattern with unbounded quantifier nesting rejected
    Given a per-repo override file containing the malicious pattern "(a+)+b"
    When the maintainer runs the validator

  # US-15 — warn-only / enforce mode + maturity-manifest gate (DD-A2, DD-A7d)
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------

  @US-15 @AC-1
  Scenario: Default warn-only mode reports violation but exits zero
    Given a feature-delta with one E5 violation and no DDD ratification
    When the maintainer runs the validator without specifying enforcement mode
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stderr contains a warning prefix naming the violation

  @US-15 @AC-2 @error
  Scenario: Enforce mode refused when maturity manifest marks rules pending
    Given the rule maturity manifest reports "row_pairing_R1" as "pending"
    When the maintainer runs the validator with the enforce flag
    Then the exit code is 78
    And stderr contains "cannot enable --enforce: rules pending"
    And no validation runs in misconfigured mode

  @US-15 @AC-3
  Scenario: Enforce mode runs validation when manifest reports all rules stable
    Given the rule maturity manifest reports every required rule as "stable"
    And a well-formed feature-delta with no violations
    When the maintainer runs the validator with the enforce flag
    Then the exit code is 0
    And validation runs to completion

  # US-INFRA-1 — schema.json single source of truth (DD-A1)
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------

  @US-INFRA-1 @AC-1 @real-io @adapter-integration
  Scenario: Schema file validates against draft-07 metaschema
    Given the shipped schema at "schemas/feature-delta-schema.json"
    When the validator loads the schema file at startup
    Then the schema validates against the JSON Schema draft-07 metaschema
    And the schema defines WaveSection, CommitmentRow, DDDEntry, and OriginAnnotation

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # US-INFRA-2 — rule maturity manifest (DD-A2)
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------

  @US-INFRA-2 @AC-1 @real-io
  Scenario: Maturity manifest is consistent with rule code
    Given the rule maturity manifest at "nWave/data/feature-delta-rule-maturity.json"
    When the consistency check runs
    Then every rule reported as "stable" corresponds to a rule that returns the documented behavior
    And every rule reported as "pending" corresponds to a rule whose code path raises pending-rule
