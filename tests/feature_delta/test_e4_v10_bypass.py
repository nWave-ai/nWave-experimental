"""Regression lock: E4 v1.0 word-padding bypass is a CONCEDED gap.

US-09 AC-3 / US-09 AC-4: documents and regression-locks the known v1.0
limitation that word-padding (10+ words with no consequence verb) bypasses
the E4 heuristic.

This test MUST remain GREEN as long as v1.0 is active.
When US-12 v1.1 ships, this test may be retired or updated to assert
the new behavior under check_v1_1().
