"""Fitness function: doc-claims vs impl-default consistency for canon migration.

CONTRACT_SHAPE: pure-function
Outcome anchor: After running test suite, developers see doc-claims-vs-impl-default
drift fails CI immediately, not in user reports.

Asserts that the documented default canon (declared in
``nWave/templates/step-tdd-cycle-schema.json:canon_migration.default_for_new_logs``)
matches the runtime defaults exposed by:
1. ``TDDSchemaLoader().load().tdd_phases`` (active phase list getter)
2. ``DESConfig().rigor_tdd_phases`` (fallback default tuple)

Generalizes the pattern shipped in ``test_skill_command_consistency.py`` (#52,
commit 0d8803030): same architectural family — fitness function for the
doc-claims-vs-impl-default drift class. Parametrize allows future extension to
additional invariants without churning the test structure.

Empirical anchor: RCA at docs/feature/fix-des-canon-default-migration/. Schema
claims ``default_for_new_logs == "v5"`` (3-phase canon per ADR-025) but both
runtime defaults still return the legacy 5-phase list — drift that the prior
test suite cemented rather than exposed (RC-D).
