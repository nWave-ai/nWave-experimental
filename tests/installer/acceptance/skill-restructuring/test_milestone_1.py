# =============================================================================
# RUNTIME GUARD: Installed skill files are actually readable on disk
# (Category A -> runtime layer)
#
# The BDD scenarios above call SkillsPlugin.install() and assert result.success.
# They do NOT verify the files physically landed in the target directory with
# correct content. This test answers the orthogonal question:
#   "Are the installed SKILL.md files readable from the target path?"
#
# Deletion test: if copy_skills_to_target() had a silent bug that reported
# success but wrote nothing, all BDD assertions above would still PASS, but
# this test would FAIL -- catching the regression before users discover their
# agents cannot load skills.
