"""Edge case tests for the OpenCode DES shim fail-open behavior.

Step 02-01: The TS shim must fail-open (allow the tool call) for ALL
subprocess failure modes. These Python tests verify the CONTRACT between
the shim and the adapter for edge cases:

1. Unknown tools (bash, etc.) must be skipped entirely
2. Subprocess timeout must fail-open
3. Subprocess crash (non-zero exit, not 2) must fail-open
4. Missing Python binary must fail-open

Since we cannot run TypeScript from Python tests, these tests verify:
- The Python adapter's actual behavior for edge cases
- The contract expectations (exit codes, JSON format) that the shim relies on
