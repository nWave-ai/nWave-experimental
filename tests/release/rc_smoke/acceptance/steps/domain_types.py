"""Domain types for the rc-cross-os-multitool-validation acceptance suite.

Mandate-12 (criterion 1): every domain noun used in the Gherkin and the
step methods is expressed once here as a typed enum / dataclass. Step methods
and the in-memory composition consume these types — never raw ``str`` where a
domain enum exists.

Vocabulary shared across the suite (all under
``tests/release/rc_smoke/acceptance/steps/``):
  * test_smoke_orchestration.py   (SmokeRunner orchestration + exit-code contract)
  * test_tool_contract_registry.py (per-tool ToolContract behaviour)
  * test_platform_passthrough.py  (US-5 --platform contract)
  * test_unknown_tool_rejection.py (unregistered target diagnostic)

This is a config-/orchestration-shaped feature (one smoke lane, finite tool
set), so Tier B (state-machine PBT) is NOT warranted (Mandate 10 skip rule).
The real cross-OS install runs ONLY in the ``validate-rc-multitool`` CI gate;
this suite drives the harness through in-memory fakes (see ``fakes.py``).
