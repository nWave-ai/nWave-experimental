"""Wheel invariant: every UTILITY_SCRIPTS entry must be force-included.

Bug-fix regression guard for the v3.12.1 install regression (Bug #1):
PyPI wheel `nwave_ai==3.12.1` shipped with `install_nwave_target_hooks.py`
and `validate_step_file.py` ABSENT because two whitelists diverged — the
dev-tarball list in `build_dist.py` and the Hatch force-include map in
`patch_pyproject.py` were never wired together. Installer reported
"Scripts verified (0/0)" and aborted with `agent/command sync mismatch`.

The dev-build whitelist `scripts.build_dist.UTILITY_SCRIPTS` enumerates the
top-level scripts (e.g. install_nwave_target_hooks.py, validate_step_file.py)
that the installer's verifier expects under <install_root>/scripts/. Those
scripts ship correctly into the dev tarball, but they were ABSENT from the
PyPI wheel because `scripts/release/patch_pyproject.py` rewrites the
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include] block and historically only
declared the `scripts/install` and `scripts/shared` SUBDIRECTORIES — never the
top-level utility files. Result: PyPI wheel `nwave_ai==3.12.1` shipped with
those scripts missing, installer reported "Scripts verified (0/0)" and failed.

This module locks the invariant: every entry of `UTILITY_SCRIPTS` MUST be
referenced as a force-include source key in the patched pyproject.toml.
The test FAILS before the fix (entries omitted from the force-include map)
and PASSES after the fix (entries added).

Pure assertion over the patcher's textual output — no subprocess, no real
build invocation. The patcher's regex generator is fully deterministic, so
checking for the exact `"name" = "name"` line proves the wheel build will
include the source file at the same destination.

BDD scenario mapping:
  - fix-v3-12-2-install-regression / step 01-01:
    "PyPI wheel ships every utility script declared in build_dist".
