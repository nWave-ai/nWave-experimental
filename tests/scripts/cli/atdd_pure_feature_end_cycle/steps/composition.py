"""Composition root for the nw-deliver feature-end-cycle coherence slice.

slice-15 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 D6). Mandate-12 +
Pillar 3: business logic lives here as the single source of truth; step bodies
delegate to ``FeatureEndCoherenceComposition`` methods and never inline logic.

WHY this is a coherence composition and not a CLI composition
-------------------------------------------------------------
slice-15 ships only the D6 feature-end-cycle *prose* added to
``nWave/skills/nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` -- prose, no executable entry point. There
is no driving-port CLI to invoke. The driving surface is the SKILL.md
*content*: the coherence test reads the file and asserts the feature-end-cycle
contract clauses are present (the Class-P executable-coherence-test mechanism
the rollout's own ``[REF] Slice classes`` section mandates -- feature-delta
L160-163, slice-04/slice-10 precedent).

Regression contract: every NEW-clause assertion FAILS on master and PASSES
once slice-15 lands. On master ``nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` describes the atdd_pure
path only as a per-slice DELIVER sequence -- ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` and
``C_REVIEWER_AUDIT`` are PER-SLICE phases in that sequence.
There is NO once-per-feature feature-end cycle, NO collapsed deep
review with final integrity verification, NO ``FeatureEndCheckpoint`` resume
record. Each NEW contract's ``master_absent_substring`` is verified absent on
master, so the coherence assertions are genuine missing-functionality RED, not
test bugs.

The SUT is the real shipped file at its real repo path -- the production
artifact, read as-is (Pillar 3: app as in production, no hand-built fixture
copy of the skill).
