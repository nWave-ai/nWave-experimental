"""Domain types for the nw-deliver feature-end-cycle coherence slice.

slice-15 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 D6).

Mandate-12 criterion 1: every domain noun used in the Gherkin is expressed
once here as a typed enum / dataclass / NewType. Step bodies and the
composition service consume these typed parameters -- no raw ``str`` where a
domain enum exists.

WHY a coherence-test domain model and not a CLI domain model
------------------------------------------------------------
slice-15's only deliverable is the D6 feature-end-cycle *prose* added to
``nWave/skills/nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` -- a skill / orchestration prose file. It
ships NO CLI, NO ``main()``, NO exit code; ``master`` vs post-slice-15 differ
ONLY in markdown text. A behavioural / regression AT is structurally
impossible -- there is nothing to invoke. Per the refined H3 rule
(feature-delta ``[REF] Slice classes``) a slice whose entire deliverable is
``.md`` prose is Class P, gated by the executable coherence test.

WHY a SEPARATE test from slice-04's ``atdd_pure_nw_deliver_spine``
------------------------------------------------------------------
slice-04 (commit ``8d78f5c6c``) shipped the per-slice spine prose into the
SAME file and its own coherence test
(``tests/scripts/cli/atdd_pure_nw_deliver_spine/``) gates that per-slice
contract. slice-04's scope was frozen at its commit *before* the D6 refinement
was ratified (2026-05-20). slice-15 ships the feature-end-cycle prose -- a
named, separately-committed Class-P slice (feature-delta L915-952, follow-up
note HIGH-2/HIGH-3). This module therefore types ONLY the feature-end-cycle
clauses; it does NOT duplicate slice-04's per-slice-spine clauses. The one
PRESERVATION clause here is the cross-slice regression guard that slice-15's
edit does not DELETE slice-04's per-slice spine prose (Pillar 2: chained
narrative -- slice-15 builds on slice-04, never overwrites it).

class FeatureEndClause(str, Enum):
    """The D6 feature-end-cycle contract clauses for slice-15.

    Each clause is one half of the ADR-028 D6 ``nw-deliver`` feature-end cycle.
    The coherence test asserts every clause is present in
    ``nw-deliver/SKILL.md``. On master the SKILL.md describes the atdd_pure
    path only as a per-slice DELIVER sequence:
    ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` and ``C_REVIEWER_AUDIT`` are listed
    as PER-SLICE phases -- master has NO once-per-feature
    feature-end cycle, NO collapsed deep review, NO ``FeatureEndCheckpoint``
    resume record. slice-15 adds exactly that prose.

    Clauses split into two kinds (see ``ClauseKind`` / ``FeatureEndContract``):

    FEATURE_END_CYCLE_DEFINED (NEW -- design note L930-934)
        Under atdd_pure, after the last slice's ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` commit,
        ``/nw-deliver`` runs ONE once-per-feature feature-end cycle: a
        whole-feature ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` refactor
        (L1-L6 whole-feature, batch-then-verify) run once, not per slice. The
        master-absent token is ``feature-end cycle`` (the per-slice
        ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` phase is on disk, but the once-per-feature
        *cycle* framing is the genuinely new clause).
    DEEP_REVIEW_COLLAPSED (NEW -- design note L933-934)
        The feature-end cycle's deep adversarial review COLLAPSES the per-slice
        ``C_REVIEWER_AUDIT`` and ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` review into one review of
        the coherent finished feature, followed by final integrity
        verification. The master-absent token is ``final integrity``.
        ``C_REVIEWER_AUDIT`` / ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` are in
        present_substrings so a SKILL.md that names the cycle but never
        collapses the two reviews is still caught.
    FEATURE_END_CHECKPOINT (NEW -- design note L938-941, ADR-028 D6 L379-389)
        Each feature-end-cycle step boundary appends a
        ``"event": "FeatureEndCheckpoint"`` record to the AT-completion
        ledger; ``/nw-continue`` reads the latest ``FeatureEndCheckpoint`` and
        resumes the feature-end cycle at the recorded step when all slice-plan
        rows are ``shipped``. The master-absent token is
        ``FeatureEndCheckpoint`` (0 occurrences on master).
    PER_SLICE_SPINE_PRESERVED (PRESERVATION -- slice-04 cross-slice guard)
        slice-04 (commit ``8d78f5c6c``) shipped the per-slice spine prose --
        the ``ATDD-Pure Roadmap-Free Spine`` section and the per-slice DELIVER
        loop -- into the same file. slice-15 ADDS the feature-end-cycle prose
        ALONGSIDE it. This clause is the regression guard that slice-15's edit
        does not DELETE slice-04's per-slice spine. It is a PRESERVATION
        clause: green on master by design, NO master-absent token (a false
        "absent on master" claim is forbidden -- slice-04 review Blocking 1
        precedent).
