"""Step definitions: the nw-deliver atdd_pure spine documents the feature-end cycle.

ADR-028 D6 / slice-15 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout.

Layer 3 (FS-reading coherence). Example-only, no PBT machinery (Mandate 9/11):
the four feature-end-cycle contract clauses are a closed enumerable set, the
three NEW ones realised as a ``Scenario Outline``, NOT a Hypothesis @given.

Step bodies delegate to ``FeatureEndCoherenceComposition``; no inline business
logic (Mandate-12 criterion 3) -- each body is a typed lookup plus a
composition call or a single assertion over a composition-computed value.

Regression contract: every NEW-clause scenario FAILS on master and PASSES once
slice-15 lands. On master ``nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` describes the atdd_pure path
only as a per-slice 3-phase DELIVER sequence -- ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT``,
``C_REVIEWER_AUDIT``, ``D_REFACTOR_COMMIT`` are PER-SLICE phases. It does NOT
define a once-per-feature feature-end cycle, NOT a collapsed deep review with
final integrity verification, NOT a ``FeatureEndCheckpoint`` resume record.
Each NEW clause's master-absent token is verified absent on master, so these
are genuine missing-functionality RED, not test bugs.

This test is SEPARATE from slice-04's ``atdd_pure_nw_deliver_spine`` coherence
test (shipped, commit 8d78f5c6c) -- that test gates the per-slice spine
contract over the same file; this test gates ONLY the feature-end-cycle
clauses slice-04 did not cover.

See the acceptance brief WAVE: DISTILL section for the testable-surface
finding: slice-15 ships only prose, so this executable coherence test is the
honest mechanical gate (the Class-P mechanism the rollout itself mandates).
