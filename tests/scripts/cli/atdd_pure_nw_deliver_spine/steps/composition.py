"""Composition root for the nw-deliver spine-branch coherence slice.

slice-04 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 D5). Mandate-12 +
Pillar 3: business logic lives here as the single source of truth; step bodies
delegate to ``SpineCoherenceComposition`` methods and never inline logic.

WHY this is a coherence composition and not a CLI composition
-------------------------------------------------------------
slice-04 ships only ``nWave/skills/nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` -- prose, no executable
entry point (verified: no ``nw_deliver``/``deliver`` orchestrator under
``src/`` or ``scripts/``; ``carpaccio_slice_gate.py`` does not parse the slice
``Class`` column). There is no driving-port CLI to invoke. The driving surface
is the SKILL.md *content*: the coherence test reads the file and asserts the
four slice-04 spine-branch contract clauses are present with correct mode
scoping (the Class-P executable-coherence-test mechanism the rollout's own
``[REF] Slice classes`` section mandates -- feature-delta L160-163,
slice-10 precedent L621-671).

Regression contract: every assertion FAILS on master and PASSES once slice-04
lands. On master ``nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` frames atdd_pure as an *inner phase
the DELIVER sequence replacement* of the classic per-step cycle (L78) -- it does NOT branch the
whole spine, skip Phase 1 roadmap, provision the telemetry ledger dir, or route
on the slice Class column. Each contract's ``master_absent_substring`` is
verified absent on master, so the coherence assertions are genuine
missing-functionality RED, not test bugs.

The SUT is the real shipped file at its real repo path -- the production
artifact, read as-is (Pillar 3: app as in production, no hand-built fixture
copy of the skill).
