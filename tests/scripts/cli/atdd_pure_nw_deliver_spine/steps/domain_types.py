"""Domain types for the nw-deliver spine-branch coherence slice.

slice-04 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 D5).

Mandate-12 criterion 1: every domain noun used in the Gherkin is expressed
once here as a typed enum / dataclass / NewType. Step bodies and the
composition service consume these typed parameters -- no raw ``str`` where a
domain enum exists.

WHY a coherence-test domain model and not a CLI domain model
------------------------------------------------------------
slice-04's only deliverable is ``nWave/skills/nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` -- a
skill/prose orchestration file. It ships NO CLI, NO ``main()``, NO exit code.
The slice-04 design note's declared ATs (no roadmap.json/execution-log.json
under atdd_pure; carpaccio gate invoked; classic byte-for-byte unchanged;
Phase 6 ledger verification; Class-P routing) are all outcomes of *an LLM
interpreting the SKILL.md prose at runtime* -- there is no deterministic
runtime that "runs ``/nw-deliver``".

The only mechanically-checkable, master-fails / slice-04-passes surface is
therefore the SKILL.md *content itself*: a permanent executable coherence test
(the Class-P mechanism the rollout's own ``[REF] Slice classes`` section
specifies for files whose contract is a semantic role -- feature-delta L160-163,
slice-10 precedent L621-671). This module types the contract clauses that test
asserts. See the WAVE: DISTILL finding in the acceptance brief: slice-04 is
Class-mislabelled C and is genuinely Class P.

    Each clause is one half of the ADR-028 D5 ``nw-deliver`` spine branch. The
    coherence test asserts every clause is present in ``nw-deliver/SKILL.md``
    with the correct mode scoping. On master the SKILL.md describes the
    atdd_pure path only as an inner 3-phase DELIVER *replacement* of the classic
    per-step cycle (L78: "the classic 3-phase per-step dispatch ... is
    REPLACED") -- it does NOT branch the WHOLE spine, does NOT skip Phase 1
    Roadmap, does NOT provision the telemetry directory in place of
    des-init-log, and Phase 6 still reads "Roadmap integrity verification".

    Clauses split into two kinds (see ``ClauseKind`` / ``SpineContract.kind``):

    SKIP_ROADMAP_AND_LOG (NEW -- AT a)
        Under atdd_pure the spine creates NO roadmap.json and NO
        execution-log.json -- step 1.a (des-init-log) and Phase 1 (Roadmap
        Creation + Review) are SKIPPED, not run-then-discarded.
    CARPACCIO_GATE_REPLACES_PHASE_1 (NEW -- AT b)
        Under atdd_pure the carpaccio slice gate runs as the per-slice
        entry_gate IN PLACE OF Phase 1 roadmap creation, before the first
        A_GREEN dispatch, AND the spine runs the per-slice
        DISTILL->DELIVER DELIVER loop -- one the DELIVER sequence pass per slice -- in place of
        the single whole-feature roadmap-step extraction. The per-slice loop
        substring is asserted explicitly so a SKILL.md that swaps the gate but
        keeps the whole-feature step loop is still caught.
    CLASSIC_SPINE_UNCHANGED (NEW -- AT c)
        The classic spine is preserved as a sibling top-level workflow --
        byte-for-byte unchanged, explicitly named so the orchestrator cannot
        fall through from the atdd_pure path into roadmap creation.
    PHASE_6_LEDGER_VERIFICATION (NEW -- D5 / feature-delta L362)
        Under atdd_pure, Phase 6 "Deliver Integrity Verification" verifies the
        AT-completion ledger + slice-plan (all rows shipped) + commit-trailer
        chain -- NOT roadmap/execution-log integrity. A spine rewrite that
        leaves Phase 6 saying only "roadmap integrity verification" is a
        half-implemented branch this clause catches.
    CLASS_P_SKIPS_CARPACCIO_GATE (PRESERVATION -- AT d, reframed)
        A ``Class = P`` slice does NOT invoke the carpaccio entry_gate -- the
        spine reads the slice plan's Class column and runs the coherence check
        instead. This routing prose was ALREADY shipped by slice-03
        (``nw-deliver/SKILL.md`` L92, the carpaccio entry_gate note, which
        forward-references slice-04 spine routing). slice-04 rewrites the
        surrounding spine into sibling workflows; this clause is the
        regression guard that the rewrite PRESERVES the inherited routing. It
        is a PRESERVATION clause: green on master by design, NO master-absent
        token (a false "absent on master" claim is forbidden -- review
        Blocking 1).
