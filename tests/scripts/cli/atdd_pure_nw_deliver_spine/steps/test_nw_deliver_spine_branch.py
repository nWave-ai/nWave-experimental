"""Step definitions: the nw-deliver spine branches on workflow mode.

ADR-028 D5 / slice-04 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout.

Layer 3 (FS-reading coherence). Example-only, no PBT machinery (Mandate 9/11):
the four spine-branch contract clauses are a closed enumerable set, realised as
a `Scenario Outline`, NOT a Hypothesis @given.

Step bodies delegate to `SpineCoherenceComposition`; no inline business logic
(Mandate-12 criterion 3) -- each body is a typed lookup plus a composition call
or a single assertion over a composition-computed value.

Regression contract: every scenario FAILS on master and PASSES once slice-04
lands. On master `nw-deliver/SKILL.md` frames atdd_pure as an inner phase
the DELIVER sequence replacement of the classic per-step cycle -- it does NOT branch the whole
spine into sibling workflows, skip Phase 1 roadmap creation, provision the
telemetry ledger dir, bump the telemetry schema, or route on the slice Class
column. Each clause's master-absent token is verified absent on master, so
these are genuine missing-functionality RED, not test bugs.

See the acceptance brief WAVE: DISTILL section for the testable-surface
finding: slice-04 ships only prose, so this executable coherence test is the
honest mechanical gate (the Class-P mechanism the rollout itself mandates).
