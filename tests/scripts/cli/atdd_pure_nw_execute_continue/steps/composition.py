"""Composition root for the nw-execute / nw-continue mode-coherence slice.

slice-08 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 D6; feature-delta
``### slice-08`` design note, L685-725). Mandate-12 + Pillar 3: business logic
lives here as the single source of truth; step bodies delegate to
``ExecuteContinueCoherenceComposition`` methods and never inline logic.

WHY this is a coherence composition and not a CLI composition
-------------------------------------------------------------
slice-08 ships four ``.md`` files -- two skill ``SKILL.md`` files and two
command ``task`` docs -- all prose, no executable entry point. The skill files
are slash-command instruction sets an LLM interprets; the task docs are command
definitions. None is code with a callable surface; there is no driving-port CLI
to invoke. The driving surface is the doc *content*: the coherence test reads
each production file and asserts the slice-08 mode-coherence contract clauses
(the Class-P executable-coherence-test mechanism the rollout's own
``[REF] Slice classes`` section mandates -- feature-delta L199-202, slice-04 /
slice-05 precedents).

Regression contract: every NEW and MODE_SCOPED assertion FAILS on master and
PASSES once slice-08 lands. On master all four files are mode-UNAWARE -- no
``workflow.mode`` branch, no ``atdd_pure`` path, no ``carpaccio`` /
``per-slice lean cycle`` / ``A_GREEN`` vocabulary, no ``un-shipped slice``
or ``FeatureEndCheckpoint`` resume cue -- and they mention ``roadmap.json`` /
``execution-log`` on lines with NO ``classic`` / ``workflow.mode`` qualifier.
Each NEW contract's ``master_absent_substring`` is verified absent on master and
each MODE_SCOPED contract's ``master_present_substring`` is verified
present-and-unscoped, so the coherence assertions are genuine
missing-functionality RED, not test bugs.

The SUT is the real shipped file at its real repo path -- the production
artifact, read as-is (Pillar 3: app as in production, no hand-built fixture
copy of the skill / command doc).
