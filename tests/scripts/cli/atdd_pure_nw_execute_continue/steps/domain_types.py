"""Domain types for the nw-execute / nw-continue mode-coherence slice.

slice-08 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 D6; feature-delta
``### slice-08`` design note, L685-725).

Mandate-12 criterion 1: every domain noun used in the Gherkin is expressed once
here as a typed enum / dataclass / NewType. Step bodies and the composition
service consume these typed parameters -- no raw ``str`` where a domain enum
exists.

WHY a coherence-test domain model and not a CLI domain model
------------------------------------------------------------
slice-08's four deliverables are all ``.md`` -- two skill ``SKILL.md`` files
(``nw-execute``, ``nw-continue``) plus two command ``task`` docs
(``nw/execute.md``, ``nw/continue.md``). None ships a ``main()``, an exit code,
or a callable surface; master vs post-slice differ ONLY in markdown text. The
executable mechanics the prose describes (per-slice the DELIVER sequence dispatch, the
AT-completion ledger, the carpaccio gate) are shipped by the Class-C slices
01-03/14, NOT here. Per the refined H3 rule (feature-delta ``[REF] Slice
classes``, L224-262) a slice whose ENTIRE deliverable is ``.md`` prose is
Class P, gated by the executable coherence test -- NOT by ``@slice-NN``
behavioural ATs, because none can exist for prose (there is nothing to invoke).
The feature-delta already types slice-08 as Class P (slice plan row L38, H3
re-audit row L277).

This module types the contract clauses the coherence test asserts. It mirrors
the slice-04/slice-05 precedents
(``tests/scripts/cli/atdd_pure_nw_deliver_spine/``,
``tests/scripts/cli/atdd_pure_nw_bugfix_mode/``) and extends them with a fourth
clause kind -- MODE_SCOPED -- because slice-08's design-note gate has a
*per-line semantic-role* predicate the bare NEW/ABSENCE/PRESERVATION token model
cannot express: every line mentioning ``roadmap.json`` / ``execution-log`` must
co-occur with a ``classic`` / ``workflow.mode`` qualifier (the slice-10
semantic-role-predicate pattern -- feature-delta L777-783).

FOUR clause kinds, one ``__post_init__`` invariant
--------------------------------------------------
- NEW          -- prose genuinely added by slice-08. Carries a
                  ``master_absent_substring`` VERIFIED absent on master; the
                  coherence AT FAILS on master, PASSES once slice-08 lands.
- ABSENCE      -- a stale phrase slice-08 REMOVES. Carries a
                  ``master_present_substring`` VERIFIED present on master; the
                  coherence AT FAILS on master and PASSES once it is gone.
                  (slice-08 declares no ABSENCE clause -- the kind is carried
                  for model parity with slice-05 and ``__post_init__`` coverage;
                  see the SLICE_08_CONTRACTS comment.)
- PRESERVATION -- prose already shipped, guarded against deletion. Carries
                  NEITHER master token; GREEN on master by design.
- MODE_SCOPED  -- a token that is LEGITIMATE under ``classic`` but on master
                  appears UNQUALIFIED (no ``classic`` / ``workflow.mode``
                  co-occurrence on its line) -- the stale "roadmap/log is
                  unconditional" framing. Carries a ``master_present_substring``
                  (the audited token, VERIFIED present-and-unscoped on master).
                  The contract is NOT "remove the token" (a bare ``absent``
                  regex would wrongly forbid the legitimate classic-mode
                  reference -- feature-delta L778-781) but "every line carrying
                  the token also carries a qualifier from
                  ``MODE_QUALIFIER_TOKENS``". FAILS on master (lines unscoped),
                  PASSES once slice-08 mode-scopes every line.

A NEW clause MUST declare ``master_absent_substring`` and MUST NOT declare
``master_present_substring``; an ABSENCE clause is the mirror; a MODE_SCOPED
clause declares ``master_present_substring`` (like ABSENCE) but, unlike ABSENCE,
the token is NOT removed -- it is qualified; a PRESERVATION clause declares
neither. ``SliceClauseContract.__post_init__`` enforces this so a false
"absent on master" / "present on master" claim cannot silently re-enter (the
slice-04 review Blocking-1 false-RED defect).

#
# DESIGN-NOTE DISCREPANCY (reported in the acceptance brief). The design note
# (feature-delta L721-722) says "every roadmap / execution-log mention
# co-occurs with a ... qualifier" for ALL four files. But master nw-continue
# (both the SKILL and the task doc) has ZERO roadmap.json occurrences -- a
# roadmap MODE_SCOPED clause for the continue pair would have an empty audited
# line set and so would be VACUOUSLY satisfied on master (no line to qualify),
# i.e. it could never FAIL -- a non-falsifiable, non-regression assertion. Per
# the slice-04 review Blocking-1 discipline (no false / vacuous regression
# claims) the continue pair carries an execution-log MODE_SCOPED clause ONLY.
# The execute pair carries BOTH (roadmap.json + execution-log) because both
# tokens are genuinely present-and-unscoped on master there. This is honest
# coverage: every MODE_SCOPED clause below has a non-empty audited line set on
# master and therefore genuinely FAILS on master.
