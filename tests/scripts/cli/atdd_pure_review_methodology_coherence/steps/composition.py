"""Composition root for the review-methodology + reviewer-agent coherence slice.

slice-10 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 3-phase DELIVER sibling
spine + ADR-029 PO/ATD reviewer DoR/DoD re-split). Mandate-12 + Pillar 3:
business logic lives here as the single source of truth; step bodies delegate
to ``ReviewMethodologyCoherenceComposition`` methods and never inline logic.

WHY this is a coherence composition and not a CLI composition
-------------------------------------------------------------
slice-10 ships only the atdd_pure-coherence *prose* edited into six
review-methodology / reviewer-agent files -- prose, no executable entry point.
There is no driving-port CLI to invoke. The driving surface is the file
*content*: the coherence test reads each file and asserts the slice-10
contract clauses hold (the Class-P executable-coherence-test mechanism the
rollout's own ``[REF] Slice classes`` section mandates -- slice-04 / slice-09 /
slice-15 precedent).

Regression contract -- two mechanisms (slice-10 design note H2-final):

* REGEX (4 files): every ``present_regex`` token is verified 0 occurrences on
  master 2026-05-20 -- so the PRESENT predicate FAILS on master and PASSES once
  slice-10 lands. The ``absent_regex`` tokens are ALSO 0 on master (vacuity
  audit, domain_types.py docstring): the absent clause is a non-regression
  GUARD, not the slice-10 RED signal. ``evaluate_regex_clause`` returns both
  results so the step layer asserts the falsifiable PRESENT predicate as RED
  and the non-falsifiable ABSENT predicate only as a documented guard.

* SEMANTIC-ROLE (2 files): the ledger token "AT-completion ledger" is verified
  0 occurrences on master in both files -- predicate 1 FAILS on master. Each
  file carries 3 unscoped ``execution-log.json`` lines on master -- predicate 2
  FAILS on master. Both predicates are genuine missing-functionality RED.

The SUT is the real shipped file at its real repo path -- the production
artifact, read as-is (Pillar 3: app as in production, no hand-built fixture
copy of the skill / agent spec).
