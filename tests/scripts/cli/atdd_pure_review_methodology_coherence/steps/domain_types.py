r"""Domain types for the review-methodology + reviewer-agent coherence slice.

slice-10 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout (ADR-028 3-phase DELIVER sibling
spine + ADR-029 PO/ATD reviewer DoR/DoD re-split).

Mandate-12 criterion 1: every domain noun used in the Gherkin is expressed once
here as a typed enum / dataclass / NewType. Step bodies and the composition
service consume these typed parameters -- no raw ``str`` where a domain enum
exists.

WHY a coherence-test domain model and not a CLI domain model
------------------------------------------------------------
slice-10's only deliverable is the atdd_pure-coherence prose edited into six
review-methodology / reviewer-agent files -- three skill ``SKILL.md`` files and
three reviewer ``.md`` agent specs. All six are prose: NO CLI, NO ``main()``,
NO exit code; ``master`` vs post-slice-10 differ ONLY in markdown text. A
behavioural / regression AT is structurally impossible -- there is nothing to
invoke. Per the refined H3 rule (feature-delta ``[REF] Slice classes``) a slice
whose entire deliverable is ``.md`` prose is Class P, gated by the executable
coherence test (slice-04 / slice-09 / slice-15 precedent).

THE SLICE-10 CONTRACT -- two coherence mechanisms, six files
------------------------------------------------------------
The slice-10 design note (feature-delta L751-835) fixes the gate as
"100% mechanical, two mechanisms":

* REGEX coherence check -- 4 files. Each carries a bare-token contract: an
  ``absent_regex`` that MUST match zero lines after the slice and a
  ``present_regex`` that MUST match >=1 line after the slice. POSIX ERE,
  case-sensitive.

    | File                          | absent_regex                       | present_regex               |
    |-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
    | nw-review/SKILL.md            | extension of ADR-025                | roadmap-free sibling spine  |
    | nw-deliver-orchestration/...  | phase-count extension                   | roadmap-free sibling spine  |
    | nw-product-owner-reviewer.md  | AC derived from UAT                 | slice plan passes           |
    | nw-acceptance-designer-rev... | derived from PO Given-When-Then     | ATs ARE the acceptance crit |

* SEMANTIC-ROLE executable coherence test -- 2 files (nw-tdd-review-enforcement,
  nw-software-crafter-reviewer). The forbidden item is the *semantic role*
  "``execution-log.json`` is THE / the sole phase record". A bare absent_regex
  on ``execution-log\.json`` is wrong -- it would also forbid the legitimate
  classic-mode reference. The contract is a falsifiable positive predicate:
    - Predicate 1: the file NAMES the atdd_pure phase record -- "AT-completion
      ledger" (a master-absent token).
    - Predicate 2: every line mentioning ``execution-log.json`` co-occurs with
      a ``classic`` / ``workflow.mode`` qualifier on the SAME line.

VACUITY AUDIT -- 2026-05-20 (acceptance brief requirement)
----------------------------------------------------------
Per the slice-10 task spec, every clause already satisfied on master is
non-falsifiable and must be flagged. Grep evidence against current master:

  REGEX files -- absent_regex tokens (master occurrence count):
    nw-review/SKILL.md            "extension of ADR-025"            -> 0  *
    nw-deliver-orchestration/...  "phase-count extension"               -> 0  *
    nw-product-owner-reviewer.md  "AC derived from UAT"             -> 0  *
    nw-acceptance-designer-rev... "derived from PO Given-When-Then" -> 0  *
  REGEX files -- present_regex tokens (master occurrence count):
    nw-review/SKILL.md            "roadmap-free sibling spine"      -> 0
    nw-deliver-orchestration/...  "roadmap-free sibling spine"      -> 0
    nw-product-owner-reviewer.md  "slice plan passes"               -> 0
    nw-acceptance-designer-rev... "ATs ARE the acceptance criteria" -> 0

  (*) VACUITY FLAG. All four ``absent_regex`` patterns ALREADY match zero
  lines on master. The design-note gate semantics ("absent_regex MUST match
  zero AFTER the slice") are still satisfied -- but the absent clause is
  NON-FALSIFIABLE: it cannot distinguish master from post-slice-10. There is
  no stale literal to delete in any of the four files. Per the task's vacuity
  rule these absent clauses are flagged, NOT shipped as standalone assertions.

  HOW slice-10's regex contract is kept HONEST despite the vacuous absent
  clauses: the ``present_regex`` token of every regex row is verified 0
  occurrences on master -- so the PRESENT predicate is genuinely falsifiable
  (FAILS on master, PASSES once slice-10 adds the prose). The coherence test
  therefore asserts the PRESENT predicate as the regression signal, and
  asserts the ABSENT predicate only as a guard that the absent token stays
  zero (which it already is) -- the absent guard is documented as a
  non-regression invariant, not a slice-10 RED signal. The regression RED for
  every regex file comes exclusively from the falsifiable PRESENT predicate.

  SEMANTIC-ROLE files -- 2026-05-20 grep evidence:
    nw-tdd-review-enforcement/SKILL.md  "AT-completion ledger"     -> 0
    nw-tdd-review-enforcement/SKILL.md  "execution-log.json" lines -> 3,
        ALL unscoped (no classic / workflow.mode qualifier): L93, L95, L260.
    nw-software-crafter-reviewer.md     "AT-completion ledger"     -> 0
    nw-software-crafter-reviewer.md     "execution-log.json" lines -> 3,
        ALL unscoped: L80, L86, L171.
  Both semantic-role files are NON-VACUOUS for BOTH predicates: predicate 1
  fails (the ledger token is absent on master), predicate 2 fails (each file
  has >=1 unscoped execution-log.json line). No vacuity flag for the two
  semantic-role files.

WHY a SEPARATE test directory
-----------------------------
slices 04 / 09 / 15 ship coherence tests over disjoint file sets. slice-10's
six files (three review skills + three reviewer agents) are disjoint from
those. ``atdd_pure_review_methodology_coherence`` is the slice-10-scoped
directory (underscores, per the directory-naming mandate).
