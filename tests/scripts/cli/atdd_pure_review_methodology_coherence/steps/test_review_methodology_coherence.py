"""Step definitions: the review methodology and reviewer agents document the
atdd_pure roadmap-free spine.

ADR-028 3-phase DELIVER sibling spine + ADR-029 reviewer DoR/DoD re-split /
slice-10 of the atdd-pure-roadmap-free-rollout.

Layer 3 (FS-reading coherence). Example-only, no PBT machinery (Mandate 9/11):
the slice-10 contract is a closed enumerable set -- six files across two
coherence mechanisms -- realised as three ``Scenario Outline``s, NOT a
Hypothesis @given.

Step bodies delegate to ``ReviewMethodologyCoherenceComposition``; no inline
business logic (Mandate-12 criterion 3) -- each body is a typed lookup plus a
composition call or a single assertion over a composition-computed value.

Regression contract -- two mechanisms (slice-10 design note H2-final):

* REGEX (4 files): every ``present_regex`` token is verified 0 occurrences on
  master 2026-05-20 -- the "names the atdd_pure roadmap-free spine" Then FAILS
  on master and PASSES once slice-10 lands. The ``absent_regex`` tokens are
  ALSO 0 on master (vacuity audit) -- the "stale classic-only framing is
  absent" And step is asserted only as a documented non-regression guard, never
  as a slice-10 RED signal.

* SEMANTIC-ROLE (2 files): the ledger token "AT-completion ledger" is verified
  0 occurrences on master in both files -- predicate 1 FAILS on master. Each
  file carries 3 unscoped ``execution-log.json`` lines on master -- predicate 2
  FAILS on master. Both are genuine missing-functionality RED.

This test is SEPARATE from slices 04 / 09 / 15 (coherence over disjoint file
sets); slice-10 targets six disjoint files.

See the acceptance brief WAVE: DISTILL section for the testable-surface
finding: slice-10 ships only prose, so this executable coherence test is the
honest mechanical gate (the Class-P mechanism the rollout itself mandates).
