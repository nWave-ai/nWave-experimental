"""Walking-skeleton @wiring_e2e integration test for the ATDD-pure carpaccio spine.

The carpaccio per-slice ENTRY path is a composition of four spine CLIs:
``carpaccio_slice_gate.py`` (the consumer) reads a feature-delta's ``[REF] Slice
Plan`` table + the feature's ``.feature`` files + the AT-completion ledger that
``at_review_verdict.py`` (the producer) writes. Slices 01-15 of the spine
rollout shipped each CLI with isolated unit/AT tests using hand-shaped fixtures.
NO test wired them together against a real feature's ``.feature`` files
end-to-end. That gap let three "fixture passes, real invocation fails" defects
ship (see ``docs/analysis/atdd-pure-dogfooding-friction-2026-05-20.md``):

  * F-04 — the gate hardcoded the AT directory to
    ``tests/scripts/cli/{feature_id}/acceptance`` (the rollout's own coherence-
    test layout). A real feature places ``.feature`` files per the DISTILL
    test-placement decision, OUTSIDE that path → gate found 0 scenarios.
  * F-06 — the F-04 fix's ``_file_feature_tags`` stopped scanning at the first
    ``#`` Gherkin comment line, so a ``.feature`` file with a leading comment
    block (before the ``@feature-`` tag) yielded zero file-level tags → the
    gate could not bind the file to the feature.

Both passed their own unit fixtures (comment-free, in-the-hardcoded-path) and
failed on the real ``wheel-privacy.feature``. A subprocess-real ``@wiring_e2e``
test that exercises the ENTRY path against a realistic feature layout closes
that whole class. This is the integration-layer walking skeleton the 5-layer
mandate requires but the spine rollout never produced.

Layer discipline (memory ``feedback_layered_test_discipline_universe_per_layer``):
this is an integration / walking-skeleton test — real composition via
subprocess, real I/O, kept lean (two tests). Universe is the user-visible
end-to-end output: subprocess exit code + emitted JSON ``event`` / ``reason``.
Each test builds a fully self-contained tmp project so it never reads or
mutates real-repo state (the real feature ledger lives under gitignored
``.nwave/`` — a test that touched it would be Fixture Theater of the worst kind).
